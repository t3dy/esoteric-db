We are counting on the assistance of skilled proof readers to produce a final improved version where errors of spelling as well as such passages where the idiom remains unclear have been corrected. We then hope that this will present a valuable addition to the presently available selection of material on alchemy in the English language. Magaphon was the pseudonym of Pierre Dujols, one of the greatest French erudites around the beginning of the XXth century. He belonged to the circle around Fulcanelli.

It seems that this little book was first published, under the title De Lapide PhilosophicoTriga Chemicum (Prague 1599) compiled by the Frenchman Nicolas Barnaud prominent in the alchemical circles around Rudolf II. However, this tract and its emblemmatic drawings circulated in manuscript during the last two decades of the 16th century, as is attested by a number of copies dated to this period which still survive in libraries and special collections today. [Of these we might mention Ms 16752 in the National Museum in Nurnberg, and the manuscript copy in the University of Leiden.] The Book of Lambspring is a short work with an introductory section in verse and an emblem showing a threefold furnace.

The book focuses on how the practice of alchemical psychology, through the power of imagination and the archetypal Feminine, can lead to healing and transformation for individuals and culture. Alchemy, Jung, and Remedios Varo offers the first in-depth psychological treatment of the role alchemy played in the friendship between Varo and Leonora Carrington\u2014 a connection that led to paintings that protest the pitfalls of patriarchy.

Rampling / Early Science and Medicine 18 (2013) 45-86 Depicting the Medieval Alchemical Cosmos: George Ripley\u2019s Wheel of Inferior Astronomy Jennifer M. Rampling* University of Cambridge Abstract Alchemical images take many forms, from descriptive illustrations of apparatus to com- plex allegorical schemes that link practical operations to larger cosmological structures. I argue that George Ripley\u2019s famous Compound of Alchemy (1471) was intended to be read in light of a circular figure appended to the work: the Wheel. In the concentric circles of his \u201clower Astronomy,\u201d Ripley provided a terrestrial analogue for the planetary spheres: encoding his alchemical ingredients as planets that orbited the earthly ele - ments at the core of the work. The figure alludes to a variety of late medieval alchemical doctrines. Yet the complexity of Ripley\u2019s scheme sometimes frustrated later readers, whose struggles to decode and transcribe the figure left their mark in print and manu - script.

Deemed insane by the Christian church, Ru- pecissa had spent more than a decade con- fined to prisons\u2014in one case wrapped in chains and locked under a staircase\u2014yet ill treatment could not silence the friar\u2019s apoca- lyptic message.

He claimed that knowledge of the natural world, and alchemy in particular, could act as a defense against the plagues and wars of the last days.

Introduction Visualization in medieval alchemy is a relatively late phenomenon. Documents dating from the introduction of alchemy into the Latin West around 1140 up to the mid-thirteenth century are almost devoid of pictorial elements.[1] During the next century and a half, the primary mode of representation remained linguistic and propositional; pictorial forms developed neither rapidly nor in any continuous way. This state of affairs changed in the early fifteenth century when illustrations no longer merely punctuated alchemical texts but were organized into whole series and into synthetic pictorial representations of the principles governing the discipline. The rapidly growing number of illustrations made texts recede to 2 the point where they were reduced to picture labels, as is the case with the Scrowle by the very successful alchemist George Ripley (d. about 1490).

Surprisingly little attention is given to the socio-cultural contexts of the craftsmen who produced them. This paper argues that alchemy originated in the Egyptian priest- hood among temple metallurgists who were responsible for making cultic objects. Access to metallurgical recipes was restricted, but with the rise of trade guilds in the Roman period, craft secrets began to circulate more freely. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that these economic shifts are the best explanation for the emergence of alchemical texts in Roman Egypt.* Keywords: Greco-Egyptian Alchemy, Zosimos of Panopolis, Metal- lurgists (Roman Egypt) Alchemical literature emerged in the \ufb01rst centuries of the common era; it consists mainly of metallurgical recipes (though some refer to ", "8606a711527950f824d6dda900b14b2b2c851857b5b3938a7ecf493131869244": "167 CHAPTER 10 SELF-KNOWLEDGE, ILLUMINATION AND NATURAL MAGIC Some Notes on Pico della Mirandola\u2019s Esotericism and Its Ancient Sources Adrian Pirtea Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin Towards dawn he awoke.

In fact, this radical dismissal of human reason would constitute Agrippa's last word on all occult sciences and the culmination of a profound intellectual evolution, brought on by the events of the Reformation. According to this view, there is a clean cut between the young Agrippa, who in 1510 drafted the project for the restoration of magic in De occulta philosophia, and the later Agrippa, a radical reformer and sceptic, who from 1526 on no longer believed in the conceptual foundations of his early project. Indeed, his De vanitate reduces magic to a mere meteoro- logical-botanical activity, condemns astrology as the mother of all superstitions, and harshly criticizes alchemy.'

The Institute\u2019s programmes encourage a perspective which is not confined to the theological and religious heritage of Islam, but seeks to explore the relationship of religious ideas to broader dimensions of society and culture. The programmes thus encourage an interdisciplinary approach to the materials of Islamic history and thought. Particular attention is also given to issues of modernity that arise as Muslims seek to relate their heritage to the contemporary situation. Within the Islamic tradition, the Institute\u2019s programmes promote research on those areas which have, to date, received relatively little attention from scholars.

AMEN. The Golden Tripod The Preface of Basilius Valentinus, the Benedictine Concerning The Great Stone of the Ancient Sages. When I had emptied to the dregs the cup of human suffering, I was led to consider the wretchedness of this world, and the fearful consequences of our first parents' disobedience. Then I saw that there was no hope of repentance for mankind, that they were getting worse day by day, and that for their impenitence God's everlasting punishment was hanging over them; and I made haste to withdraw myself from the evil world, to bid farewell to it, and to devote myself to the service of God. When I had spent some years at the monastery, I found that after I had performed my work and my daily devotions I still had some time on my hands. This I did not wish to pass in idleness, lest my evil thoughts should lead me into new sins; and so I determined to use it for the s", "811ed026feefd40ca80867399aa497209368692c7f122de8c8090a05e089c64c": "Michael1VIaicr's ATALANTAFUGIENS SourcesofanAlchcmical BookofEmblemsH.M.E.DEJONG NICOLAS-H.-\\Y.'5\u2018.INC.

Whether rare or frequent, real or imagined, travel was, however, a cornerstone of the charlatan\u2019s identity: exoticism was a key selling point and his references to past travels supported claims to a knowledge and experience far broader than what could be acquired in just one place. Hence, with the decline of this fascination with distant worlds, the itinerant and open air character of medical charlatanism also ceased to appeal, instead becoming a mark of vulgarity, increasingly associated with a plebeian and rural clientele while those at the high end of the occupation turned into sedentary shopkeepers.

From this, ignoring Leonardo's own silence on social questions, he extrapolates to claim that Leonardo must also have believed in the possibility of a \"new world, created by man,\" where the dog- eat-dog relationships of the world of the fables would no longer exist. Zubov provides no documentary support for this claim, but it is upon this very debatable interpretation that he closes a work otherwise noteworthy for his- torical insight and accuracy.

For instance, in his otherwise fine introduction in the Riverside edition, Hallett Smith writes: \u2018It might be said that the title of the play should be The Island rather than The Tempest, for the storm occupies only the first scene of the play and the island pervades all of it.\u2019 2 Had Smith realized that the \u2018tempest\u2019 is, amongst other things, an alchemical one, i.e.\u2018a boiling process which removes impurities from base metal and facilitates its transmutation into gold\u2019, 3 it is unlikely that he would have proposed an alternative title.

Sara D\u00edaz reads Boccaccio\u2019s diatribe against mar- riage in the Trattatello in laude di Dante, linking it to misogyny and arguing that misogamous rhetoric serves to help establish the authority of Dante \u2019s vernacular poetics among Latin hu- manists. In the last chapter of this section, Mary Anne Case traces Boccaccio\u2019s ideas on the hu- manity of women, using Christine de Pizan\u2019s Le livre de la cit\u00e9 des damesas the measuring post for Boccaccio\u2019s philogyny in the De mulieribus and in Decameron 6.7, which she argues pres- ents women as both fully human and Christ-like. Part 4 turns to the \u201cpolitical and authorial contexts \u201d of Boccaccio \u2019s treatise on famous women. Elizabeth Casteen examines Boccaccio \u2019s shifting attitude to Queen Johanna I of Naples from the Amorosa visione to the De mulieribus, showing how their respective reputa- tions come to be bound together a", "418ce594f6f560210194fbd4474536a0bbf2de6a9aafcb8ac8ebdda21953cc4f": "University of North Carolina Press is collaborating with JSTOR to digitize, preserve and extend access to Studies in Philology . http://www.jstor.org A Probable Paracelsian Element in Shelley Author(s): Elizabeth Ebeling Source: Studies in Philology, Vol. 32, No. 3 (Jul., 1935), pp. 508-525 Published by: University of North Carolina Press Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/4172289 Accessed: 25-11-2015 19:11 UTC Your use of the JSTOR archive indicates your acceptance of the Terms & Conditions of Use, available at http://www.jstor.org/page/ info/about/policies/terms.jsp JSTOR is a not-for-profit service that helps scholars, researchers, and students discover, use, and build upon a wide range of content in a trusted digital archive.

By Marshall Clagett. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. Pp. xxxii + 720. 1964. $12.00. Only fifteen years ago a leading historian of medieval western science could write that, in the Middle Ages, Archimedes was \"almost or entirely unknown\". The appearance of this massive volume is proof of the astonishing progress made in recent years in the study of the exact sciences in the Middle Ages: progress to which Professor Clagett's own contribution, as scholar, teacher and editor, has been immense. The translations direct from the Greek, and especially that by William of Moerbeke in 1269, have been reserved for Volume 2; the bulk of the present work consists of Latin versions, with English translations, of Archimedean treatises which derived from the Arabic tradition. In this tradition, versions of the De mensura circuli and of the first book of the De sphaera et cylindro were of prime importance, providing", "7c2682ef422bf97d21c8299868c1bdc560cda999b7a9ea4ebd5b0e33ad38917d": "The British Society for the History of Science Science, Medicine and Society in the Renaissance.

With an Introduction by Allen G. Debus. New York: Science History Publications, 1979. Pp. xii +156. $40.00/\u00a320.00. Robert Fludd's Philosophicall Key is a learned gallimaufry of some anti- quarian interest. It portrays, in simple if not lucid terms, the world system of a late renaissance Neoplatonist. It quotes interesting letters to Fludd from German literati. It reveals many curious details of his alchemical experiments, describes many novel properties of 'Wheat. . . that most excellent temple & vegetable tabernacle of Queene Nature', and recounts the creation of the world in chemical terms. Altogether it helps one to see just why Kepler and Mersenne treated Fludd with such intolerance. Professor Debus describes his edition as a 'Transcription' of the text with an introduction. The description is precise. Debus has copied his manuscript with some care, but h", "374009e10408a909c9093d718b1b2cecb56d812ff68cea8fd81a45717e61df2e": "The British Society for the History of Science Review Author(s): Pamela H.

DEBUS* INthe past two decades there has been an ever increasinginterestinthe role played by the followers of Paracelsus during the ScientificRevolution. Their chemical philosophy com bined alchemical, chemical and medical concepts ina universalscheme of nature that seemed to many to be a viable \"new science\" or \"new philosophy\". These Paracelsians carried on a widely trumpeted and spiriteddebate with Aristotelians,Galenists, and mechanists alikeuntilwell into the thirdquarter of the seventeenth century. But what happened after that time? Since they were seldom referred to in eighteenth-century scientificjournals itissometimes suggested that they faded away with the triumph of the mechanical philosophy. In thispaper we hope to show that thiswas not the case. For the most part historicalresearch on eighteenth-century chemistry has focused o", "76613aecd6bcb30ac1141718d751d672e51b1e690d31523a37a47aefb99bfa0c": "REVIEW The 550th Anniversary of the Universit/C228t Basel, 1460 \u2013 2010: Paracelsian Beginnings and Chemistry by G.

After its inception, the development of chemistry has played a major role in its evolution as an academic institution to meet the needs of industry and the educational community . Chemistry evolved in Basel as a dominant industry because of its central location and connection to the Rhine. The dyestuff industry and later the pharmaceutical industry established the Basel location as a major center of distribution. Companies like Sandoz AG, Ciba AG, J.

Sci., xii (1974), 200-211 RECENT PARACELSIAN STUDffiS Walter Pagel Paracelsus- Theophrastus Bombastus of Hohenheim (1493-1541)-speaks to us in several tongues. One of these belongs to the lay-theologian and social reformer. His sermons, Biblical commentaries, Marian and eucharistic tracts, his social and political precepts and his instructions seem as voluminous as his medical, chemical, naturalistic, philosophical and 'occult' works. The latter are extant in the critical edition of Sudhoff which runs to fourteen volumes. The same number of volumes is envisaged for the corpus of the theological remains, which started to appear almost twenty years ago; five volumes are so far available. The work under notice is presented as a Supple\u00ad ment.' It contains shortened and in places modified versions of preceptorial and religious-social tracts. In view of the peculiar and unfortunate fate of the full texts, they can claim our particular interest.

In the often confusing research of alchemy, several themes can be identified. From a historical perspective, it\u2019s a forerunner to chemistry, and an archaic fusion of spiritualism and science, related to the idea of the natural transmutation of substances into increasingly perfected states. Scholars of classics and mythology associate alchemy with the elixir of immortality and the philosophers\u2019 stone, a magical substance that confers a range of astonishing powers upon the user, including the ability to speak to animals or angels, as well as the healing of all illnesses. Skeptics might, as I once did, imagine alchemy primarily as the domain of charlatans and counterfeiters of metals, who claim to be able to transmute lead into gold with this red stone.

Introduction The Chronographia of George Synkellos, the 9th century Byzantine chro- nicler, preserves a curious fragment from the alchemist and Hermetic philoso- pher, Zosimos of Panopolis. In this passage, which is not extant in the Greek alchemical manuscripts, Zosimos seems to lend his support to a dark and unwholesome view of the alchemical art and its origins. It is stated in the holy scriptures or books, dear lady, that there exists a race of daimons who have commerce with women. Hermes made mention of them in his Physika; in fact almost the entire work, openly and secretly, alludes to them. It is related in the ancient and divine scriptures that certain angels lusted for women, and descending from the heavens, they taught them all the arts of nature. On account of this, says the scripture, they offended god, and now live outside heaven\u2014because they taught to men all the evil arts which a", "0bef90cbd4345dc677af5a60e44bd44340fa316381509db6cfa20f41cf70211f": "Journal rrl' lhc Wilshinglon Academy ol' Scicnccs.

In his works alchemy was placed at the service of a mystical religion aimed at spiritual gnosis, but its practical dimension remained a central concern 1. Unlike his immediate successors, the commentators, for whom alchemy became primarily a speculative endeavor centered on the exposition of texts 2, Zosimos maintained an activ\ufffd interest in the performance of chemical operations. Indeed, many of his works display a deep interest in the technology of furnaces and apparatus and the minutiae of chemical recipes.

Their relationship provides an important window into the historical development of erotic themes in alchemical literature. I argue that there is an erotics of pedagogy at work in this text, rooted in alchemical allegories of the fusion of male and female substances and Islamic notions of the initiatory relationship between teacher and student.

These texts, dating from the late fifth century BCE to the second century CE, have been part of the scholarly debate on ancient afterlife beliefs since the end of the nineteenth century. Recent finds and analysis of the texts have reshaped our understanding of their purpose and of the perceived afterlife. The tablets belonged to those who had been initiated into the mysteries of Dionysus Bacchius and relied heavily upon myths narrated in poems ascribed to the mythical singer Orpheus. After providing the Greek text and a translation of all the available tablets, the authors analyze their role in the mysteries of Dionysus, and present an outline of the myths con- cerning the origins of humanity and of the sacred texts ", "0d087b9c4f3dfbe91ff50e368a1e2a5b01edfb4d936a36517b484cfbf0e0c4e7": "i THE GNOSTIC WORLD The Gnostic World is an outstanding guide to Gnosticism, written by a distinguished international team of experts to explore Gnostic movements from the distant past until today.

Texts examined include fragments of Valentinus, Heracleon, and Ptolemy\u2019s Letter to Flora, in addition to the Valentinian source included in the Excerpta ex Theodoto by Clement of Alexandria and related sections in Irenaeus\u2019s Adversus haereses. Auvinen asserts that the number of parallels with Philo in the Valentinian sources increases the likelihood that there was a historical relationship between Philo\u2019s writings and Valentinian teachers.

David Litwa What does it mean for Jesus to be \u201cdeified\u201d in early Christian literature? Early Christians did not simply assert Jesus\u2019 divinity; in their literature, they depicted Jesus with the specific and widely recognized traits of Mediterranean deities. Relying on the methods of the history of religions and ranging judiciously across Hellenistic literature, M. David Litwa shows that at each stage in their depiction of Jesus\u2019 life and ministry, early Christian writings relied on categories drawn not from Judaism alone, but on a wide, pan-Mediterranean understanding of deity. PRAISE FOR IESUS DEUS \u201cIn Iesus Deus, M. David Litwa surveys six of the more significant ways in which early Christians from the first through the third centuries ce drew on a common reservoir of ancient Mediter - ranean conceptions of deity as models for expressing the ultimate significance of Jesus, namely his divine origin and deity.

David Litwa POSTHUMAN TRANSFORMATION IN ANCIENT MEDITERRANEAN THOUGHT There is not just a desire but a profound human need for enhance- ment \u2013 the irrepressible yearning to become better than ourselves. Today, enhancement is often conceived of in terms of biotechnical intervention: genetic modi\ufb01cation, prostheses, implants, drug ther- apy \u2013 even mind uploading. The theme of this book is an ancient form of enhancement: a physical upgrade that involves ethical prac- tices of self-realization. It has been called \u2018angeli\ufb01cation\u2019 \u2013 a trans- formation by which people become angels. The parallel process is \u2018daimoni\ufb01cation,\u2019 or becoming daimones.

This volume of \u0083tudes constitutes a valuable interpretation of this document as a chapter in the history of medi\u00beval religious thought. The Queste is dated about 1220,\u00d1a fact which renders its attribution to Gautier Map, who died before 1210, \u00d2fantastic.\u00d3 As we shall see, it was plainly conceived by someone writing under the influence of the Cistercian Order, and it was intended to be a picture of the victorious Christian life as shown forth to medi\u00beval humanity by the White Friars.

A living cell can indeed be viewed as just a very small drop of liquid containing thousands of molecules that are accessible to chemical investigations and exchange energy and matter with the environment. A cell, though small, is quite visible and observable, and thus a cell and its molecular content can be studied by modern imaging techniques. Even though the chemical characterization of the large repertoire of natural molecules is not a new science, chemistry will continue to contribute to the understanding of the real nature of life. This is because chemistry is the science of both \u201cinformed\u201d and \u201ctransformed\u201d matter. Life arises indeed from \u201cinformed\u201d matter.

The form\u2019s origins are complex, and it is built on assumptions about the natural world, art and language that both precede and mark the Renaissance. Of central importance is the medieval view that depicted nature as a book or a mirror, and invested everything with a corresponding significance. Art as a page in the Book of Nature, or as a pas\u00ad sage from the Bible, is amenable to interpretation on several levels, and poetry and pictures may signify something beyond what they actually are and beyond what they seem to represent. The combination of signs and figures with a few words makes sharp-witted instruction possible.

Although the fifteenth century showed some signs of traditionalism and disintegration, there were also highly original new solutions to long-debated prob- lems in scholastic and humanistic discourse. As for the relation between faith and reason, Nicholas of Cusa, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, and Savonarola found new ways to integrate these poles, around which theological and philosophical thought was organized. As a common pattern, one can discern a striving beyond the established systems of humanism and scholasticism, mingling elements of both traditions with those from the movements of spiritual reform in the later Middle Ages. This \u201cstriving beyond\u201d was possible due to a performative turn in the fifteenth century: thinking and acting were connected by the narrator or t", "8918afb000e3a2a91e583b0e0d440eca6dce38fce083130416be1e1454f70e35": ")DOVH\u000f\u0003/\\LQJ\u00036SLULWV\u0003DQG\u0003$QJHOV\u0003RI\u0003/LJKW \u0003$PELJXRXV 0HGLDWLRQ\u0003LQ\u0003'U\u00035XGG V\u00036HYHQWHHQWK\u0010&HQWXU\\\u00037UHDWLVH RQ\u0003$QJHO\u00030DJLF (JLO\u0003$VSUHP Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft, Volume 3, Number 1, Summer 2008, pp. 54-80 (Article) 3XEOLVKHG\u0003E\\\u00038QLYHUVLW\\\u0003RI\u00033HQQV\\OYDQLD\u00033UHVV DOI: 10.1353/mrw.0.0096 For additional information about this article Access provided by University of California , Santa Barbara (10 Feb 2015 08:13 GMT) http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/mrw/summary/v003/3.1.asprem.html False, Lying Spirits and Angels of Light Ambiguous Mediation in Dr Rudd\u2019s Seventeenth-Century Treatise on Angel Magic EGIL ASPREM University of Amsterdam INTRODUCTION \u2018\u2018His only (but great and dreadful) error [was], that he mistook false lying Spirits for Angels of Light, the Divel of Hell . . . for the God of Heaven.\u2019\u2019 With these words the seventeenth-century scholar Meric Casaubon (1599\u2013 1671) introduced and condemned the famous angel conversations of John Dee (1527\u20131609) and his scryer Edward Kelly (1555\u201397), descr", "6321c20ad3a7631cc6cb33f20db4703eeaa0bb6b7e1de72fc193fcaf68e2e626": "THE NATURE OF H/STORIA IN LEON BATTISTA ALBERTI'S DE f/CTURA In this artiele I inquire into Alberti' s elaim that bis treatise, De Pictura (1435), offers a totally new treatment of painting. I argue that the rationale behind Alberti' s self\u00ad promoting elaim derives from bis perception of historia, and from his conceptualization of the relationsbip between this pictorial geme and nature. The historia is not a depic\u00ad tion ofthe natural, the contingent and the temporal: The nature that Alberti uses for his historia is an ideaI nature that cannot, in fact, be observed in nature. Alberti' s historia deconstructs natural reality in an attempt to reconstruct the unobservable, t\u00ecxed princi\u00ad ples wbich lie bebind the surface ofthe visible world.

I reckon many of the harder questions involving religious difference such as Multani would require both legal and nonlegal approaches for their resolution. Deep Equality provides a path for both. Overall, the book is a very useful corrective to prevailing theoretical and practical approaches vis-\u00e0-vis religious identity and diversity. The reader will find the ethnographic work particularly illuminating in grounding many of the abstract theories and concepts often employed in discussions involving religious freedom and in emphasizing that deep equality depends, by and large, on people recognizing similarities in one another. Deep Equality thus significantly broadens the frame with which we view these debates, not only in terms of methodology but also substance.

BROWN Program in Health, Medicine, and Society City College of the City University of New York One of the most striking features of English physiology in the forty years between 1730 and 1770 was the dramatic, indeed precipitous decline of varieties of mechanism and the rapid rise to preeminence of alternate varieties of vitalism. In 1733 Stephen Hales published his Haemastaticks. 1 This collection of twenty-five \"statical experiments\" about the functioning of animal bodies was dedicated to verifying and extending, with the help of precise, quantitative Newtonian investiga- tive techniques, the hydraulic theory of the \"animal oeconomy\" that British medical writers from Archibald Pitcairne to Richard Mead had made widely popular between 1695 and 1715. 2 Hales carefully measured blood pressure, determined the velocity of efflux from the heart, experimentally exhibited impedance caused by capillary ramifica- ", "b2e40e9a6581cf403ce7a86f23f1bbd0aeea711911ffcb67187b47af9cc7f1b4": "J.

(Received 6 February 1968, and in revisedform 18 June 1968) The distribution of living systems cannot be predicted in terms of chemis- try and physics because there are relationships in living systems that cannot be understood in terms of energy, but only in terms of advantage. It is proposed that the drive toward the maximum advantage be defined as the vitalistic principle. Vitalism is a philosophy which regards life as ultimately mysterious and unexplainable in terms of chemistry and physics. Crick (1966) has attacked vitalism on the grounds that life is mysterious only in proportion as one is ignorant of molecular biology: \u201cProvided, then, that scientific study con- tinues on a considerable scale, we can foresee a time when vitalism will not seriously be considered by educated men . . . to those of you who may be vitalists I", "cf0c933896a29f8bb6aa05f24147e0bf1a9b6f4b059afca238851b1815ae0d60": "392 Literaturkritik Irmgard M\u00e4nnlein-Robert (Hg.), \u00dcber das Gl\u00fcck.

The constant attention he devoted to Aristotle and his Arabic commentators (Averroes in particular) demonstrates their importance to his worldview; yet he differs little in this respect from other philosophers and theologians of his day. One aspect, however, of his use of authorities does set him apart from his contemporaries: his frequent citation of the mythical author Hermes Trismegistus.' In 1980, the Italian scholar Loris Sturlese published an article on Albert's employment of Hermetic ideas and texts in his writings,^ and he provided a useful and vir- tually complete table of citations of Hermes in Albert's works.

We detail a very wide range of evaluations run to assess the model\u2019s safety and alignment. We describe: tests related to model safeguards; assessments of safety in agentic situations where the model is working autonomously; cybersecurity evaluations; a detailed alignment assessment including stress-testing of the model in unusual and extreme scenarios; evaluations of model honesty and reward-hacking behavior; a tentative investigation of model welfare concerns; and a set of analyses mandated by our Responsible Scaling Policy on risks for the production of dangerous weapons and autonomous AI research & development. Among several novel evaluations, we include a suite of alignment tests using methods from the \ufb01eld of mechanistic interpretability.

It is an attempt to supply a key to the work of an Adept whose vast knowledge of occultism was unsurpassed by any previous Western authority. I have emphasized the similarity between Crowley's Cult of Thelema and Tantra because the present wave of interest in the Tantric System makes it probable that readers will be able to assess more fully the importance of Crowley's contribution to occultism in general and to the Magical Path in particular. As a result of many years' research into obscure phases of occultism I have evolved a method of dream control for contacting extra-terrestrial and non-human entities; this forms the substance of Chapters Six and Seven.

The beginning of the book \u2013 where the idea of sefirot is introduced \u2013 still represents today one of the most difficult passages in all of Hebrew literature. Even though, from the second chapter on, the discussion of the 22 letters can be generally followed and analyzed, the real cultural meaning of the sefirotic dynamic has so far resisted scholarly inquiry. Notwithstanding a large amount of new research on the Sefer Yetzirah, the most influential discussion about the etymology and the setting of the sefirot is probably still the one offered by Scholem at the beginning of his Origins of the Kabbalah. Scholem is, as usual, very clear in his pres- entation.

The text is semantically difficult, its reception is varied, and its structure is poorly understood. Various commentators have made competing claims about the nature of the Sefer Yetsirah . Some say it is practical, or theosophical, while others believe it to be a work of philosophy. I propose that there is a discerni- ble pattern in its organization which is key to understanding its meaning and function. This pattern is a ring composition, a form com- monly used in the Hebrew Bible and in late antique and early medieval works. The ring-composition form highlights passages that emphasize the practical application of the Sefer Yetsirah. Its generic form is just as important as its words in conveying meaning.

Once one accepted, as anyone with any philosophical training did, that God, or the gods, were not subject to passions, and that, as not only Stoics but also Pla- tonists, at least after the time of Plotinus, believed, the world-order was (either entirely or very largely) determined as a product of God\u2019s providence, it became a serious problem as to how precisely one could in\ufb02uence the gods, or the course of e", "65fb96f541ff6f4a97ecc3dd86cf8462c5904848f783817eac682db1994b4ae4": "\u03a3\u03a7\u039f\u039b\u0397 Vol. 4. 2 (2010) 229\u2013238 \u00a9 J.

Iamblichus of Chalcis postulated theurgy on metaphysical grounds as the only means of communion with the supreme principle of everything that exists. Iamblichus sets this principle as a completely transcendent reality, unattainable by reason, and, at the same time, differs from Plotinus, who postulated absolute withdrawal from everything and con- ceived union with the One as an escape in solitude to the solitary. Iamblichus conceives mat- ter as an instrument for the soul\u2019s ascent to that principle and explicitly proposes a mysticism of solidarity with the cosmos and with other souls.

In reading the book, Dee has systematically compared the text with Pantheus\u2019s earlier work, the Ars Metallicae , and noted any differences between the two largely identical works. Therefore, most of Dee\u2019s comments are not indications of his own interests, as has previously been assumed. Only the marginalia that are not concerned with comparing the two texts can be taken to express Dee\u2019s own views.

These themes are the effective power of symbols, and of the Hebrew letterform speci\ufb01cally, and theosophy, the belief that the created world can be used to learn about the divine. The Sefer Yetsirah expresses an effective view of symbols and a theosophic view of the universe. This theosophic view is intrinsic to the astrological outlook that informs the work. The commentaries on the Sefer Yetsirah take different positions regarding these themes, relying on non-Jewish sources and cosmological models to reinterpret the magical function of the Hebrew letterform, and the theosophic signi\ufb01cance of the created world. In so doing, the commentators reinterpret the Sefer Yetsirah in light of contemporary debates. The Sefer Yetsirah is a", "9c1a8125a3d181e15866df337e3b5dc596ccf15cf530bc9778417500e679a733": "Revue des \u00e9tudes juives Early Philosophical Commentaries on the Sefer Ye\u1e93ira : some Comments Raphael Jospe Abstract Many of the early Jewish philosophers wrote commentaries or otherwise related in their works to the Sefer Yezirah', these include Sa'adia Ga'on, Dunash ibn Tamim, Shabbetai Donnolo, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Judah ben Barzillai al-Barge-loni, and Judah Ha-Levi. Sa'adia established a tradition of interpreting Sefer Yezirah 1 :1 (\"He created his world by three sefarim \") as meaning sefer (writing), sefar (number), and sippur (speech). Judah Ha-Levi, despite his reputation as an anti-rationalist philosopher and opponent of Aristotelianism, interpreted the three sefarim innovatively in Aristotelian terms of the identity of the subject, act and object of intellection. The favorable attitude of many early Jewish philosophers towards the Sefer Yezirah contrasts sharply with the widespread attitude of silence or condemnation of another mystical text from the rabbinic period, the Shi'u", "3785b0399fd3d4e3a5c4dde28553d8d240323ee177bf310592f9e5894585dbb7": "\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05e4 \u05de\u05e8\u05d4\"\u05e7 \u05e8\u05e4\u05e1\u05dc \u05d4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9 \u05e7\u05e8\u05e4 \u05df\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05dd\u05e9\u05d1 \u05dd\u05e9\u05d4 \u05e8\u05e2\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0 \u05e8\u05e9\u05e2: \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05d1\u05d1 \u05e8\u05e4\u05e1 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05dc \u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e0\u05e2 \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05e4\u05d1 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05e4\u05e1\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05d0\u05d5 \u05dd\u05d4\u05d1\u05e9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e8\u05d1\u05e0 \u05dd\u05d9\u05de\u05e9 \u05e5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5 \u05dd\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05db\u05d5 \u05e8\u05e9\u05d0 \u05dd\u05d1 .\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d5\u05e0\u05de\u05de \u05df\u05d9\u05d9\u05e2\u05de\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d0\u05d1\u05e0\u05e9 \u05d5\u05d1 \u05da\u05e8\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05d4 ,\u05d0\u05dc\u05e9 \u05d5\u05e0\u05dc\u05d1\u05e7 \u05d5\u05d1 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d3 ,\u05dc\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d5\u05e0\u05e7\u05e1\u05e2 \u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05d1\u05d1 \u05e8\u05e4\u05e1\u05d4 \u05dd\u05d5\u05ea\u05d7\u05d4 \u05e1\u05d1\"\u05d3: )\u05d0 (\u05dd\u05d9\u05e9\u05dc\u05e9\u05d1 \u05dd\u05d9\u05ea\u05e9\u05d5 \u05ea\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05e0 \u05ea\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05dc\u05e4 \u05d4\u05de\u05db\u05d7 \u05e7\u05e7\u05d7 \u05d9\"\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\"\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d5\u05d0\u05d1\u05e6 \u05ea\u05d0 \u05d5\u05de\u05dc\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d4\u05e9\u05dc\u05e9\u05d1 \u05dd\u05d9\u05e8\u05e4\u05e1 \u05e8\u05e4\u05e1\u05d1 \u05e8\u05e4\u05e1 \u05e8\u05d5\u05e4\u05e1\u05d5 ) \u05d7\u05e1\u05d5\u05e0 \u05e8\u05d7\u05d0 -

In order to preserve the transcendence of the One, while still providing a \ufb02uid universe connected to the One, Syrianus shows how the nature of the One is seen in the structure of the Parmenides itself: the \ufb01rst hypothesis of the Parmenides outlines the primal God, while the intelligible universe is the sub- ject of the second hypothesis, in so far as the intelligible universe is a product of the One. Thus, whatever is negated of the One in the \ufb01rst hypothesis contains a positive analogue in the sec", "5cf1335c1862adb4ec3699d8e1326459567b6ce8e3017b72f82a83eb944f6ead": "T HE J EWISH Q UARTERLY R EVIEW , Vol. 103, No. 1 (Winter 2013) 26\u201346 The Reception of Sefer Yetsirah and Jewish Mysticism in the Early Middle Ages TZAHI WEISS INTRODUCTION T HE B OOK OF C REATION , Sefer Yetsirah (SY), is one of the most in\ufb02uential and yet enigmatic treatises in the history of Jewish thought. 1 Scholarly discord regarding the meaning and the cultural context from which this short treatise has evolved derives from its laconic and obscure wording as well as from our incomplete knowledge concerning the way in which it was historically accepted as a canonic Jewish source. 2 To date, This work was written with the support of the Rothschild postdoctoral fellow- ship and the Shalem Center in Jerusalem.

Human beings in the proper sense are disembodied souls (Gerson 2003). Later ancient Platonists, including Plotinus ( 204-270 CE), the founder of the influential \u201cNeo-Platonic\u201d movement, were broadly sympathetic to this point of view. For Plotinus, the soul\u2019s achievement of self -knowledge might involve a mental, non -physical process of \u201ctaking away\u201d everything \u201cbodily\u201d ab out its self-image, including sensation, shape, locality and temporality (Enneads 5.3.9; 5.8.9).

Bull For a long time, the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus have been con- sidered as a part, or sometimes precursor, of those various phenomena labelled gnosis or gnosticism. Already in antiquity, there were some who claimed that Valentinus had taken his teachings from Hermes.1 Like the primary sources of gnosticism, the Hermetic treatises largely disappeared from view in the Latin West during the Middle Ages, with the notable exception of the Latin trans - lation of the Perfect Discourse, more widely known as the Asclepius. It was this text, together with the begrudging admiration of Augustine in his City of God, which preserved the reputation of Hermes until the arrival of the Greek treatises now known as the Corpus Hermeticum after the fall of the Byzantine Empire, and of the Hermetic e", "8eb1e6c91ae6f38bcb4e697e2b408264d4f9dca03a840a111deb511cc2debe5e": "Lovesickness in the Middle Ages.

The text is semantically difficult, its reception is varied, and its structure is poorly understood. Various commentators have made competing claims about the nature of the Sefer Yetsirah . Some say it is practical, or theosophical, while others believe it to be a work of philosophy. I propose that there is a discerni- ble pattern in its organization which is key to understanding its meaning and function. This pattern is a ring composition, a form com- monly used in the Hebrew Bible and in late antique and early medieval works. The ring-composition form highlights passages that emphasize the practical application of the Sefer Yetsirah. Its generic form is just as important as its words in conveying meaning.

In my view, this shortening represents a significant sharpening of the work. In the main, the author follows the path laid down by Garth Fowden and Jean-Pierre Mah\u00e9, the two pylons of modern Hermetic studies. Like these scholars, and contra the earlier consensus championed by A. J. Festugi\u00e8re, Van den Kerchove accepts the existence of a Hermetic com- munity and sees the Hermetic treatises as substantially affiliated with native Egyptian traditions, though naturally heavily influenced by Greek philosophy.

They had a lively sense of the interaction between supernatural power and the natural world. What did masculinity and femininity mean in a mental universe dominated by magic? What was the cultural impact of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation on this magical world and its images of gender? How were the boundaries between the rational and irrational drawn, and how did this affect the psychic life of men and women? Oedipus and the Devil explores the psychological dimension of popular culture in early modern Europe. Based on detailed historical case studies, and using a combination of feminist theory and psychological analysis, the book explores sexual attitudes, masculinity and femininity, magic, concepts of excess, exorcism and witchcraft.

Bull University of Oslo Christian.Bull@teologi. uio. no Abstract The Hermetic treatises have played a considerable role in the history of Western Eso\u00ad tericism. However, according to the influential definition of Antoine Faivre, Western Esotericism is a historical phenomenon originating from the fifteenth century, when Marsilio Ficino translated the Greek Corpus Hermeticum into Latin. The question, then, is if the term \u201cesotericism\u201d has any utility for understanding the original context of the Hermetic treatises, in the first centuries of the Common Era. The present contribution aims to give a summary account of research into ancient Hermetism, and consider the Hermetic treatises in light of the six elements of Faivre\u2019s conception of Western Eso\u00ad tericism. These six elements can serve as heuristic tools to single out certain salient features o", "4cb60121ec036ce311d48f33afbee4e83dee9788f6ad6f9d9a66222c8f98c5f1": "\u00a9 koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2018 | doi 10.1163/2451859X-12340047 Gnosis: Journal of Gnostic Studies 3 (2018) 34\u201353 brill.com/gnos The Notion of Truth in Some Hermetic Texts and Chaldaean Oracles Anna van den Kerchove Institut protestant de th\u00e9ologie Laboratoire d\u2019\u00e9tudes sur les monoth\u00e9ismes (UMR 8584\u2014 CNRS-EPHE) petosiris33@gmail.com Abstract The following paper is an inquiry into the notion of truth in the Hermetic fragment Stobaeus Hermetica 2a and the Chaldaean Oracles fr. 107. In both texts, the truth has an absolute status and is considered not to be present on earth. This conception has consequences for the way of evaluating sciences, divination, philosophy and ritual. In order to study how these four topics are portrayed, the article analyzes other Hermetic passages, in particular that can be found in the Asclepius. The four topics are positively evaluated only when they are related to the \u201cprimary truth.\u201d Philosophy encompasses the four topics and is defined as piety.

WITH this volume Father Festugiere continues his admirable exposition of the Hermetic doctrines, extending his survey, as before, to cover or touch upon other philosophic and religious ideas of the same age, that is those which may at least for convenience' sake be classed as Gnostic. A short preface justifies him in keeping exclusively to the Greek sources, neglecting the excursions into the beliefs of other (Oriental) countries which have been fashionable for some decades. He can find nothing which makes any such researches necessary, and an imposing array of facts pointing to the Gnostic ideas springing from the common heritage of Greek philosophical thought on religious topics.

Copenhaver Abstract Giovanni Pico della Mirandola had his900 Conclusions printed late in 1486, just a few weeks before Pope Innocent VIII attacked thirteen ofthem. Did Pico intend to provoke the Vatican? If not, what was his aim, what were his means and what was the product? TheConclusionslooks like a miscellany, just as Pico described it.

Davidson Pierre Hadot, whose inaugural lecture to the chair of the History of Hellenistic and Roman Thought at the College de France we are publishing here, is one of the most significant and wide-ranging histori- ans of ancient philosophy writing today. His work, hardly known in the English-reading world except among specialists, exhibits that rare combination of prodigious historical scholarship and rigorous philo- sophical argumentation that upsets any preconceived distinction between the history of philosophy and philosophy proper. In addition to being the translator and author of monographs on Plotinus, Victori- nus, Porphyry, and many others, Hadot's most important general philosophical work is entitled Exercises spirituels et philosophie antique.'

Hadot offers two key concepts in his study of ancient philosophy: philosophy as a \u201cway of life\u201d and \u201cspir- itual exercises\u201d, which help us to approach Thomas, especially given his regular use of the term \u201cspiritual exercise\u201d and the concept of \u201cexercise.\u201d Keywords Spiritual exercises, Aquinas, Hadot The French philosopher Pierre Hadot identified a component missing from the world of modern philosophy. His great innovation came in identifying philosophy as a \u201cway of life,\u201d accompanied by certain \u201cspiritual exercises,\u201d an insight derived from his study of ancient phi- losophy. In this understanding, only when they lived their philosophy could philosophers properly be called philosophers.

We will argue that Annas\u2019 account of virtues as skills, especially as she develops it in Intelligent Virtue (2011), can help us to understand the contested role of what Hadot terms spiritual exercises within the ancient philosophies. Seeing the spiritual exercises, via Annas, as exercises in the habituation to, and constant reanimation of skill-like virtues allows us to combat repeated charges that Hadot\u2019s claims concern- ing these exercises imply a vision of the ancient philosophies that is not intellectual- ist enough, undervaluing", "74ec8c3353eb08a0dcd7f9ab3ef362cc2ba30afe7bea15e4877a0bd14271b6e7": "Roguelike Development with JavaScript Build and Publish Roguelike Genre Games with JavaScript and Phaser \u2014 Andre Alves Garzia Roguelike Development with JavaScript Build and Publish Roguelike Genre Games with JavaScript and Phaser Andre Alves Garzia", "4ef327b6bce722a20a0cb0f68257a0de10fd11c0e4c35c15bd5b71b7b9198ff5": "Teaching Video Game Design Fundamentals This comprehensive guide provides educators with everything they need to teach video game design fundamentals.

Themes help with rules comprehension by giving reasons for the mechanics. Themes can help set players\u2019 expectations for what kind of experiences or emotions the game provides. Themes can also help to create the experience and provide atmo- sphere to the gameplay. Thematic Integration in Board Game Design examines the design and integration of theme from the standpoints of technical structure, narrative building, and the design process. This book presents multiple approaches to designing theme as well as developing and replacing themes in existing projects. The focus is on developing the design skill of mechanical integration of theme rather than developing creative writing skills. Multiple guides and exercises are included that designers can reference at various points in the design process.

Anatomy of Game Design takes some of the most popular and beloved games of all time and dissects them to see what makes them tick. By break- ing down the systems and content of each game, the underlying systems of game design are laid bare. Eight games are analyzed \u2013 including Settlers of Catan ; Centipede; Candy Crush Saga; Papers, Please; Magic: The Gathering; and more \u2013 each representing a different genre or era of game design. Each game is dis - cussed in detail, using the same methods for each game. What are the verbs of the game that give the player agency? How do those verbs fit together to form a core loop that makes the game engaging? What are the systems that power the gameplay? What is the larger flow that makes the game interesting over and over again?

This book discusses all four essential cores and how to design games by using each one as a starting point.

We argue here for a particular view of games\u2014and of learning\u2014as activities that are most powerful when they are personally meaningful, experiential, social, and epistemological all at the same time. From this perspective, we describe an approach to the design of learning environments that builds on the educational properties of games, but deeply grounds them within a theory of learning appropriate for an age marked by the power of new technologies. We argue that to understand the future of learning, we have to look beyond schools to the emerging arena of video games.

He also reviews and seeks to explain for both specialists and more general readers the great diversity of play itself, which he ultimately considers a \u201cpathway of experience\u201d that resembles other such pathways as ritual, work, and what he calls communitas. Key words: com- munitas, play, play scholarship, play studies, play theory, ritual, work Students of play realize quickly that their chosen subject is exceedingly difficult to comprehend and investigate.

She argues that all play is purposeful and can only truly consid- ered to be play when the child has chosen what to do, where and how to do it. Using case studies drawn from all over the world, Smidt challenges some of the prevailing myths relating to play and pays close attention to what early years professionals need to do to interpret the play, understand its purpose for the child and sometimes extend it. Attention is paid to the close links that play has with creativity, and the author also highlights the importance of being able to explain to colleagues, parents and even those in government, why play matters so much in terms of learning and development.

The film portrays her early years, artistic development, personal relationships, and the esoteric influences that shaped her visionary creations. Directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the movie underscores af Klint\u2019s struggles in a male-dominated art world. It features her most renowned works, which were largely overlooked during her lifetime and rarely shown to small audiences. This was not only due to the patriarchal constraints of the era but also because af Klint herself requested that her works remain hidden.

Her paintings with abstract motifs were hidden from the public eye for a long time, and they attracted the attention of sc ientists during the previous two decades. The paper will draw attention to one of the frequent themes in her works \u2013 gender duality, a topic which was close to the artists of Symbolism whose work temporally overlaps with the period of af Klint\u2019s creation. Unlike her contemporaries, painters who mostly represented gender duality as a conflict and a struggle for supremacy, af Klint por- trayed the female and male principle as partners and accomplices in creating life on earth and maintaining balance in the entire universe by employing abstract motifs. The to pic of gender reconciliation in the works of Hilma af Klint will be analyzed through her good", "64c001bbf0095caf714b85b5f0b6fcfd3c999bbc6e47d7d45f9d6c0e13c28939": "Hilma af Klint (1862 \u2013 1944) Lesbian, schizophrenic, resourceful and beautiful woman paints forbidden love and longing in a geometrical visual language no one has ever seen before.

She painted naturalistic landscapes until about 1900 when she abandoned it for abstraction. What makes af Klint\u2019s work particularly intriguing is that she described herself as a medium in which her hand was guided to paint by a spiritual guide. Pyramids and spirals speak to a greater meaning beyond a painting. Abstraction with a purpose. What makes an abstract painting about spirituality appear different from an abstract painting about painting? The symbolism in paintings by af Klint invoke pictures one might experience in one\u2019s own mind or perhaps in a spiritual trance. Geometry and language depict otherworldly sentiments, that of the occult and mystical aspects of nature and animism. Certain words ap- pear over and again; one: Evolution.

Between 1906 and 1915 af Klint created 193 works for her series Paintings for the Temple, all of which she requested in her will not be shown publicly until 20 years after her death. Since the discovery of her spiritualist paintings in the mid 1960s, the meaning of their visual elements have been scrutinized by art historians and compared to the likes of Kandinsky, Mondrian, Malevich and other early modern abstractionists. This paper focuses on the life and works of Hilma af Klint and aims to deconstruct and disregard the notion that af Klint created paintings that are abstract in the formalist, canonical sense of the word. Rather, her oeuvre consists of spiritualist paintings that were intended to be viewed", "d900d586c852d2eeb32023de5a2d499988294e6331aa668da7c590de710f7b57": "98 Summary Samenvatting Introduction: Ghosts in the Paintwork Part One: Shadows and Light A Books of Secrets Ways of Seeing Stitches in Time Black Mirrors Women, Looking Part Two: Light and Rage The Speculative Body of Bits and Pieces Hilma af Klint and Bodies of Light Louise Bourgeois \u2013 A Room of One\u2019s Own Conclusion Additional Paintings List Bibliography URL Reference List 4 6 13 30 33 55 89 109 119 152 155 191 225 251 260 260 264 CONTENTS 1110 Scars If I were an architect, an architect in love, I would redesign my body.

In the past year art history has been transformed. The works of long-neglected artist Hilma af Klint have been shown in an astonishingly triumphant exhibition entitled Paintings for the Future at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. It was the most successful exhibition in the history of the Guggenheim, with over 600 000 visitors, a 34 % increase in museum membership and a catalogue sold in record numbers, outperforming the Kandinsky catalogue. In her New York Times review Roberta Smith stated that exhibitions like these \"blow open art history\u201d . 1 This kind of mega-hit was far from obvious for someone who had demanded that her art remain hidden until 20 years after her death.

Although the identity of these figures is not clear, we are aware of their familiarity with Christian beliefs. Thus, in this paper we attempt to approach Af Klint\u2019s Christian, metaphysical and anthroposophical message by analysing her notebooks.

Jung's Mandala Sketches Kathrin Schaeppi* Abstract In this paper, I will illuminate the striking parallels in the life and art of the con\u00ad temporaries Hilma af Klint and C.G. Jung through a comparative analysis of their art-specifically af Klint's swan paintings and Jung's mandala sketches. Hilma af Klint and C.G. Jung, who never met during their lives, were informed by several shared factors. Particularly their sustained dedication to self-experimentation and connecting with a similar stream of archetypal images would result in their works' uncannily echoing the other. What is it about their art that resonates with us a century after it was produced? In this comparative analysis of their life and art, I attempt to illuminate how Hilma af Klint and C.G.

From the beginning, he has been notorious as an \"atheist\" who seeks to substitute Nature for a personal deity; yet he was also, in Novalis's famous description of him, \"the God-intoxicated man.\" He was an uncompromising necessitarian and causal determinist, whose ethical ideal was to become a \"free man.\" He maintained that the human mind and the human body are identical; yet he also insisted that the human mind can achieve a kind of eternality that transcends the death of the body. He has been adopted by Marxists as a precursor of historical materialism, and by Hegelians as a precursor of absolute idealism.

The authors offer original, synthetic accounts of the historical development of social knowledge, including its philosophical assumptions, its social and intellectual organization, and its relations to science, medicine, politics, bureaucracy, religion, and the professions. The 43 chapters include inquiries into the genres and traditions that formed social science, the careers of the main social disciplines (psychology, economics, sociology, anthropology, political science, geography, history, and statistics), and international essays on social science in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

There are by now numerous suggestions for authorship, ranging from Cosimo d\u201fMedici to Leon Battista Alberti, the Francesco Colonna of Venice to the Colonna of Rome. This paper, however, does not posit a new suggestion but rather critiques the suggestions made over the last century and the present one and s",

Since its publication in 1499, it has fascinated architects and historians with its vast display of architectural knowledge and its erudite reading of the related arts of landscape, engineering, painting, and sculpture. Its 172 wood engravings, many of which represent buildings, qualify it as the first illustrated architectural book in the history of printing. Because of its dense, almost Joycean prose\u2014a polyglot concoction of Latin, Greek, and vernacular Italian, with a smattering of Hebrew, Arabic, and hieroglyphics\u2014the book has received relatively little analysis.

The extraordinary vocabulary of this book is rich in obsolete and rare words, many of them technical terms which arise in the course of the author's fulsome descrip- tions of imaginary architecture. O.E.D. cites R.D. as the first or only user of such dead words as scale (21),1 'a salying scale or downe going staire,' inanulated (23), ' tresses of haire . . . crisping and inanulating by their eares,' Windolet (21), ' loopes or windolets in diverse places,' and even of perimeter (53) and topiary (116), words in quite a different class.

De pictura is new wine in an old bottle. But, whereas the wine has been studied over and over again, the bottle has received little scholarly attention. A proper understanding of De pictura hinges on the tripartite struc- tural division of the treatise. As Alberti explains in the famous letter of dedication to Filippo Brunelleschi (1435): You will see that there are three books. The first, which is entirely mathematical, shows how this noble and beautiful art arises from roots within Nature herself. The second puts the art into the hands of the artists, distinguishes its parts and explains them all.

It explores what it was like to live with demons, and how careers and identities were con\u00ad structed out of battles against them \u2013 or against those who granted them too much power.

Pedagogies of magic have their own cocooned metaphors waiting to hatch. In lit- erature and the arts, magic ties its practitioners to systems of learning and meth- ods of becoming. Enchanted Pedagogies , edited by Kari Adelaide Razdow, is a collection of essays by artists and writers who re flect on archetypes and tropes of enchantment, intertwining elements such as transformation, imagination, creativ- ity, and empathy. These essays evoke shapeshifters, witches, ghosts, fools, fairies, hags, gnomes, selkies, and more, exploring multi-disciplinary artistic practices. Enchanted Pedagogies presents ways to expand, imagine, and circumvent modes of creativity and pedagogies through personal, theoretical, practice based, and hybrid explorations.

The chapters traverse a broad spectrum both chronologically and thematically; yet together, their shared focus on cultural exchange and encounters emerges in an important way, revealing a valuable methodology that goes beyond the pure comparativism that has dominated historiography in recent decades. Several of the chapters touch on gender relations and contact between different religious faiths, using case studies to explore the variety of these encounters. Whilst the essays focus geographically on Europe, they prefer to investigate relationships over highlighting singular, local traits. In this way, the collection aims to respond to the challenge set by recent debates in cultural studies, for a global history that prioritises inclusivity, moving beyond biased or learned attachments to", "c08f041fbf8560acf300334f4ddb51a443d91fde2b770e7771a5e52c8391f4a3": "THE NEW MIDDLE AGES BONNIE WHEELER, Series Editor The New Middle Ages is a series dedicated to pluridisciplinary studies of medieval cul- tures, with particular emphasis on recuperating women\u2019s history and on feminist and gender analyses.

There is certainly no shortage of books on the subject. Several general surveys of the witch trials and numerous regional and micro studies have been published for an English-speaking readership. While the quality of publications on witchcraft has been high, some regions and topics have received less attention over the years. The aim of this series is to help illuminate these lesser known or little studied aspects of the history of witchcraft and magic. It will also encourage the development of a broader corpus of work in other related areas of magic and the supernatural, such as angels, devils, spirits, ghosts, folk healing and divination.

The chapters are united in their goal to explore transformations that took place in the reception and interaction process between Platonism and Christianity in this period. The contributions in this volume explore the reception of Platonic material in Christian thought, showing that the transmission of cultural content is always mediated, and ought to be studied as a transformative process by way of selection and interpretation. Some chapters also deal with various aspects of the wider discussion on how Platonic, and Hellenic, philosophy and early Christian thought related to each other, examining the differences and common ground between these traditions.

Assistan t Professor of Religious Studies, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill [ AB STRACT: Since the emergence of religious studies and the social sciences as academic disciplines in the late nineteenth century, the concept of \"magic\" has played a major role in defining religion and in mediating religion's relation to science. Many of the most important scholars in these disciplines have debated the relation of magic to religion and science, yet traditional efforts to formulate distinctions among these categories have proved notoriously unstable, the subject of repeated critique and deconstruction. The notion of magic has remained stubbornly amorphous. This book seeks to account for the extraordinary vitality of scholarly discourse purporting to define and explain magic despite its failure to do just that. The book argues that the persistence of scholarly debate", "c0f4aff13467980f07f7cdd1c1f1eafacf5f85a7ea01e50775ffc8e7fc7773c8": "Submitted for publication to Know: A Journal on the Formation of Knowledge on 10/17/2020 \"It's a Kind of Magic\u201d: Juggling Privacy and Prosecution for Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century English Magical Practitioners Sanne de Laat and Dan Harms Abstract Practitioners of ritual magic in sixteenth and seventeenth-century Britain faced both legal and social dangers, yet continued to engage in their activities with the assistance and support of other members of society.

The early tenth-century translator reports that he found two manuscripts of this treatise, for the greater part damaged by termites. However, since the preserved parts of one made up for the destroyed parts of the other, he could manage to complete his work. This translation was then the starting point for studies on magic squares in Arabic.

From the practicalities of investigating the video game as a musical source to the critical perspectives on game music \u2013 using examples including Final Fantasy VII , Monkey Island 2 , SSX Tricky and Silent Hill \u2013 these explorations not only illuminate aspects of game music, but also provide conceptual ideas valuable for future analysis.

This is a new and distinct area of practice that weaves together and extends narrative theory, spatial theory and design theory. Examples of narrative spaces, such as exhibitions, brand experiences, urban design and socially engaged participatory interventions in the public realm, are explored to show how space acts as a medium of communication through a synthesis of materials, structures and technologies, and how particular social behaviours are reproduced or critiqued through spatial narratives. This book will be of interest to scholars in design studies, urban studies, architecture, new materialism and design practitioners in the creative industries.

At times, Platonism has constituted an essential philosophical and theological resource, furnishing Christianity with an intellectual framework that has played a key role in its early development, and in subsequent periods of renewal. Alternatively, it has been considered a compromising in\ufb02uence, con \ufb02icting with the faith \u2019s revelatory foundations and distorting its inherent message. In both cases the fundamental importance of Platonism, as a force which Christianity de\ufb01 ned itself by and against, is clear. Written by an international team of scholars, this landmark volume examines the history of Christian Platonism from antiquity to the present day, covers key concepts, and engages issues such as the environment, natural science and materialism.

The essays explore Eriugena, Eckhart and Cusanus as bold thinkers deeply engaged with their times and culture. John Scottus Eriugena, Meister Eckhart and Nicholas of Cusa are key figures in the medieval Christian Neoplatonic tradition. This book focuses on their engagement with practical, experiential issues and controversies. Eriugena revises Genesis\u2019 Adam and Eve narrative and makes sexual difference and overcoming it central to his Periphyseon. Eckhart\u2019s Annunciation sermons urge his hearers to give birth to God\u2019s son within their lives, and he develops a distinctive approach to pain and suffering. His radical preaching on the Eucharist and mystical union was judged heretical but was later taken up by Nicholas of Cusa.

It is how thinkers throughout history have justi \ufb01ed existence itself, explaining temporal being vis-\u00e0-vis God. Yet in the wake of secularisation and the widespread phenomenon of disen- chantment, this once ubiquitous and coveted notion has fallen into desuetude. The essays in this volume analyse and explore this key concept in the history of Western thought. They provide, for the \ufb01rst time, a rigorous and accessible account of participation, a pivotal concept in Western philosophy and theology, from antiquity to the modern era. Bringing together contributions by an inter- national team of leading scholars of the Platonic tradition, the volume challenges a standard distinction between philosophy and theology. It also enables a comprehensive understanding of \ufb01gures who do not \ufb01t neatly into the modern university\u2019s division of thes", "85ca2a796df43fa4ebd517f7e71beb2373d1f88f0467f975ae5abe5435ca6a0b": "The Renewal of Medieval Metaphysics", "0226447d394e7340a4602f30f9707d8176032db7f748f11ab6a2fe2388c50c56": "Reading Proclus and theBook of Causes Volume 1 Dragos Calma - 978-90-04-39511-4 Downloaded from Brill.com10/12/2019 10:09:00PM via free access Studies in Platonism, Neoplatonism, and the Platonic Tradition Edited by Robert M.

Writing probably around 500 CE, and possibly connected with the circle of Severus of Antioch, Dionysius manipulates a Platonic metaphysics to describe a hierarchical universe: as with the Hellenic Platonists, he arranges the celestial and material cosmos into a series of triadic strata. These strata emanate from one uni\ufb01ed being and contain beings that range from superior to inferior, depending on their proximity to God. Not only do all things in the hierarchy participate in God, but also all things are inter-connected, so that the lower hierarchies fully participate in the higher ones. This metaphysics lends itself to a sacramental system similar to that of the Hellenic ritual, theurgy. Theurgy allows humans to reach the divine by examining the divine as it exists in creation.

It is everything and nothing, everywhere and nowhere. The One is the source [aiche] of all beings and, as the Good, the goal [telos] of all aspirations, human and non-human. As the indemonstrable first principle of everything, as transcendent infinite being, and as the supreme object of love, the One is the center of a vibrant conception of reality many of whose facets resist philosophical analysis. Efforts to understand or to define the nature of the One, Plotinus believes, are doomed to be inadequate.

O'MEARA n his Vita Plotini (17,1-6), Porphyry tells us that \"when the people < from Greece began to say that Plotinus was appropriating the ideas of Numenius, and Trypho the Stoic and Platonist told Amelius, the latter wrote a book to which we gave the title 'On the Difference between the Doctrines of Plotinus and Numenius' \"(trans. Armstrong). Whilst this evidence cautions us against making rap- prochements between Plotinus and Numenius which overlook the differences between their respective doctrines, it also encourages us to compare these doctrines, and research has in fact brought to light Numenian material in the Enneads of Plotinus. Without going into a discussion of the results of this research', this article will propose further possible points of comparison, with respect in particular to certain accounts of true Being in Plotinus and Numenius, and suggest that these might provide additional indications of ", "37cc897afad6084cff14a62fa8dc90deb7be5f419ff05718e7e42be31aee762d": "Scepticism and Ineffability in Plotinus DOMINIC J. O\u00d5 MEARA ABSTRACTThe rst part of this paper traces back to Plotinus a strategy applied by Augustine and Descartes whereby sceptical arguments are used to set aside sensualist forms of dogmatic philosophy, clearing the way for a dogmatism independent of sense- perception which is \u00d4 self-authenticating\u00d5 and thus immune to, and even proven by, sceptical doubt. It is argued that Plotinus already uses this strategy in the opening chapters of EnneadsV 5 and V 3. The second part of the paper argues that Plotinus\u00d5 account of how the ine able One is said (we do not actually say the One, but merely express our own a ections) is inspired by the structure of sceptic discourse (the sceptic does not say things as they are, but merely expresses personal a ections). Finally, similarities and di erences between scep- tic discourse about things and Plotinian discourse about the ine able are explored.

Huntington in 1929, the first volume did not reach the press until 1935; it was only partially finished when the Civil War bombardment of Madrid caused fires which destroyed twenty sets of pages in proof, the majority of fourteen finished signatures, and even the rolls of blank paper destined for the printing. Antonio Puerta (to whom the present volume is most appropriately dedicated) managed to save a few sets of the completed signatures; previous to the present publication only seven copies of the 1936 work were known to be extant.

M. does not profess to be an expert in the by now rather specialised field of Gnosticism; his contribution to the Festschrift for Gilles Quispel (where this essay originally appeared) is rather to make a most acute survey of earlier Greek philosophy, beginning with Parmenides and Empedocles (with a glance also at early Orphism and Pythagoreanism) and continuing through Plato, Aristotle, Stoics and Epicureans, to see what starting-points might have been provided, legitimately or otherwise, to a Gnostic mind for the concept of an imperfect world created by an evil or ignorant demiurge. As it turns out, there is really quite a lot; indeed, as M. concludes (pp. 312-14), the Gnostics came up with the only remaining solution that had not b", "cc2d8276d023c62e27ea7458f5193f441df1175193861acee839f6697b5f7cba": "Review: Iamblichus' Life of Pythagoras Author(s): Dominic J.

As I frequently ponder and ... carefully investigate the fact that the first and fundamental division of all things which either can be grasped by the mind or lie beyond its grasp is into those that are and those that are not, there comes to mind as a general term for them all what in Greek is called cpuaas and in Latin Natura.

The author states that \u2018consciousness\u2019 in its \u2018philosophic al meaning \u2026 means the basic, raw capacity for sentience, feeling, expe rience, subjectivity, self-agency, intention, or knowing of any ki nd whatso- ever\u2019.

INTRODUCTION When we consider which types of organism have the ethical status that we accord to human beings it soon emerges that the presence of or capacity for consciousness holds a central role in our thinking. Where an individual has not got, or has irrevocably lost, all capacity for conscious experience due to brain damage, we cannot see any point in keeping that individual alive. A plausible case can and has been made that such an individual is no longer a person at all.* However, commentators on brain death legislation note that \u2018Nowhere do we see the terms \u2018intellect\u2019, \u2018sentience\u2019 or \u2018humanness\u2019 which were so dear to the earlier whole-brain strategists, \u20193 This complaint is clearly based on the intuition that moral conc", "b4c9b4d7c9cb98815601499ca1de4dbbaf033cc898009dba9748caa1b2a38af3": "Intention and Text", "ce51a336e929dfd503de7483f5f18f307e3d0ab64300ca62f26ed9389d59871f": "Languages of Intentionality 9781441184122_FM_Final_txt_print.indd i9781441184122_FM_Final_txt_print.indd i 5/16/2001 4:27:50 PM5/16/2001 4:27:50 PM", "f863bd0927d43c06f6f429c35f7255f850e4684ae665cebb7898f7125dad10ee": "The World-Directedness of Emotional Feeling On Affect and Intentionality Jean Moritz M\u00fcller \u201cIn this carefully researched book, M\u00fcller offers detailed and sustained criticisms of standard accounts of emotional experience or feeling as a kind of \u2018axiological receptivity\u2019\u2014a form of taking in how the world is evaluatively. M\u00fcller argues that such accounts fail properly to make sense of the intentionality and the phenome- nology of emotions.

Dick In Memory of Philip K. Dick (1928-1982) Preface by Philip K. Dick I will define science fiction, first, by saying what sf is not. It cannot be defined as \"a story (or novel or play) set in the future,\" since there exists such a thing as space adventure, which is set in the future but is not sf: it is just that: adventures, fights and wars in the future in space involving super-advanced technology. Why, then, is it not science fiction? It would seem to be, and Doris Lessing (e.g.) supposes that it is. However, space adventure lacks the distinct new idea that is the essential ingredient. Also, there can be science fiction set in the present: the alternate world story or novel. So if we separate sf from the future and also from ultra-advanced technology, what then do we have that can be called sf?

Dick Elaine Pigeon Abstract Initially, the controversial writings of the science fiction author Philip K. Dick did not sell well, so he was relatively unknown at the time of his death in 1982, shortly before the release of Ridley Scott\u2019s Blade Runner, adapted from Dick\u2019s 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The film soon gained cult status and Dick\u2019s reputation as a genius began to spread. In this dystopian yet deeply moving novel, set after World War Terminus, Dick questions what it means to be human and in the process deconstructs the opposition between humans and androids. Dick was obsessed with the effects of technology and its potential to radically transform human existence. In A Scanner Darkly, a novel set in the 1990s but written in 1977, the distinction between the one doing the surveilling and the one surveilled is blurred while the pitfalls of drug abuse are addressed.

The philosophes continued to take aim at magical practices, alongside religion, as examples of superstitions that an enlightened age needed to put behind them. In addition to a continuity of beliefs and practices, the eighteenth century also saw improvement and innovation in magical ideas, the understanding of ghosts, and attitudes toward witchcraft.

Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486-1535), already a polymath and occultist of some fame, was but a young man of twenty-three, preparing to teach his first course at the University of Dole in Bur- gundy, when in 1509 he delivered the brilliant inaugural lecture that became the kernel of his treatise De nobilitate et praecellentia foeminei sexus [On the Nobility and Superiority of the Female Sex].1 The oration was dedicated to Margaret of Savoy, prin- cess of Austria and Burgundy and de jure president of the university, whose patron- age Agrippa wished to secure. Unfortunately for the young scholar's career, however, he roused the ire of the Franciscan Jean Catilinet with his ensuing course, a series of lectures on Reuchlin's cabalistic text De verba mirtfico.

Taking up the perspective of post- Tedeschi historiography and building upon the work of Tom Mayer and others, Maifreda demonstrates that although the Black Legend may be ex - aggerated, the logic and rule of law in ancien regime Europe was defnitely not that of the twentieth century, and that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to try to make the distinction between legal and moral justice in that past world of factionalism and power politics.\u201d Simon Ditchfeld, University of York \u201cGermano Maifreda is a leading scholar of the Inquisition, as his new book on the trial of Giordano Bruno shows.

It lays out a revolutionary cosmology founded on the new Copernican astronomy, one that Bruno extends to infinite dimensions, filling it with an endless number of planetary systems. As well as opening up the traditional closed universe and reducing earth to a tiny speck in an overwhelmingly immense cosmos, the work offers a lively description of Bruno\u2019s clash of opinions with a group of conservative academics and theologians in Oxford and London. This edition presents, on facing pages, a new English translation with a newly edited Italian text of what has recently been claimed as the final version of Bruno\u2019s Ash Wednesday Supper.

Studia Classica et Mediaevalia 12. Nordhausen: Verlag Traugott Bautz, 2016. 296 pp. \u20ac60. Blum\u2019s work is based on two methodological assumptions: Bruno \u2019s critical use of the philosophical tradition and his capacity to d istinguish clearly between Aristotle and his later followers, including the Scholastic tradition. In the 1980 foreword (of the original Aristoteles bei Giordano Bruno, Stud ien zur philosophischen Rezeption [1980], of which this is a translation), Blum states that it has become a commonplace to stress that Giordano Bruno \u2019s works are inundated with views, statements, and ideas taken from earlier authors. Thus, reading Bruno \u2019s works critically runs the risk of reducing his intellectual work to spheres of in \ufb02uence or of atomizing through identifying the sources. Blum, by contrast, argues that B runo deliberately used the philosophers of the past for the sake of developing his own original posi", "c66667060ed16390aca5a5aa1c7c817ecff1ed0285fb619fd2720edc695da584": "This article was downloaded by: [University of Birmingham] On: 15 November 2014, At: 23:17 Publisher: Routledge Informa Ltd Registered in England and Wales Registered Number: 1072954 Registered office: Mortimer House, 37-41 Mortimer Street, London W1T 3JH, UK The European Legacy: Toward New Paradigms Publication details, including instructions for authors and subscription information: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/cele20 Giordano Bruno's Infinitely Numerous Worlds and \u2018Lunar\u2019 Literature Bruno Ferraro a a Department of Italian , University of Auckland , Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand E-mail: Published online: 23 Nov 2006.

His examples include the failure of ordinary language in Greek societies to supply the words for such abstract concepts as 'cause' and 'effect'. A parallel crisis was experienced by early Christians in communi- cating their Christology: words such as 'sal- vation', 'justification' and 'redemption' had to be borrowed from contexts in which they were already used to signify different social trans- actions.

His most prolonged intellectual project, however, was conversations with angels using a crystal ball and a variety of assistants with visionary abilities. Dee's angel conversations have long puzzled scholars of early modern science and culture, who have wondered how to incorporate them within the broader contexts of early modern natural philosophy, religion, and society. Using Dee's marginal notes in library books, his manuscript diaries of the angel conversations, and a wide range of me- dieval and early modern treatises regarding nature and the apocalypse, Deborah Harkness argues that Dee's angel conversations represent a continuing development of his natural philosophy.

In addition, Dee compiled Sloane MSS 3191 (the primary source for this book) to be a working collection of conjurations for use in magical ceremonies. Although it is possible that Dee never went through with the experiments, it is far more likely that he recorded the events in a separate diary that has not survived.

Already in his early twenties, he started to frequent the Medicean circle and demonstrate his poetic talent. His composi- tions followed the prevailing models of the time, especially those of Lorenzo and Po- liziano, whose influence, together with that of the bucolic poets of antiquity, is clearly discernible in Benivieni's eclogues. A turning point in Benivieni's life came in 1479, when he met Giovanni Pico della Mi- randola in Florence. The closejriendship that Benivieni developed with the count of Mir\u00e1n- dola inspired him to abandon his role as a court poet and to devote himself entirely to study- ing Neoplatonism and producing philosophical poems.

The role Pico and Raphael themselves played in the establishment of this assimilation is discussed, as is the theological and intellectual background of the function of angels in this period. Especially the latter is shown to make a biographical interpretation of angelic connotations in both figures such as presented by V asari (Raphael) or Gianfrancesco Pico (Pico) extremely hazardous. Rather, elements of self-fashioning merge with theological and philosophical trends in the creation of the angelic image. T he painter Raphael has been many things to many people: artistic genius, scholar, archeologist, entre- preneur, poet, to name but a few.

Jill Kraye\u2019s \u201cPico on the Relationship of Rhetoric and Philosophy \u201d presents a tour de force in her discussion of Pico \u2019s letter to Ermalao Barbaro in which Pico entered the age-old fray of the relationship between rhetoric and philosophy. Barbaro was scornful of Aristotelians who did not know Latin or Greek and hoped to show them that \u201cthose who separate philosophy from eloquence are thought to be commonplace, insignificant and wooden philosophers \u201d (15). In response, Pico provided a strong defense of the scholastics whose substance of thought far out- weighed any deficiencies in style.

These criticisms aside, Chazan \u2019s book offers a fresh and important examination of the history of Christian attitudes toward the Jews and how those attitudes evolved from the more benign critiques in early Christian texts to the more virulent condemnations found in medieval texts. This transformation from the anti-Judaism of the early Christians to the anti-Semitism of medieval Christians is an important matter in its own right as well as crucial to understand- ing the character of modern anti-Semitism.

Anaxagoras\u2019s philosophy permits Pico to establish his doctrine that all things share a portion of God within them, in their own way. Pico rejects the fixed position of man in the ontological hierarchy. Man has the chance to become everything. Pico asserts that man con- tains all things in himself as their center, just like God contains all things as their origin. As a consequence, Anaxagoras\u2019s principle is supportive to Pico\u2019s meta physics. Furthermore, Anaxagoras\u2019s metaphysical prin- ciple is supportive of Pico\u2019s method of allegorical interpretation, which is indispensable for his syncretism and his attempt t", "b1798668cb0c1136285134a7058b62089acf4b2812604268b0a12cd076de4586": "The Case against Johann Reuchlin: Religious and Social Controversy in Sixteenth-Century Germany This page intentionally left blank", "dda73483b7c480dd928cbab7bdccb3aeca2df2a9f5baad8e0773758ecd444293": "72 IN HIS NAME REUCHLIN, LUTHER, THENAUD, WOLFF, AND THE NAMES OF SEVENTY-TWO ANGELS", "957ec0aa7885812728bf1f9f0451e3fffd1465ad9194956b428710c8e1331de2": "BSB Bayerische StaatsBibliothek MDZ Miinchcncr Di&italisierun^sZentnnn Digitale Bibliothek Reuchlin, Johannes loannis Revchlin Phorcensis LL.

Except for civil friendship, there was nothing between Reuchlin and myself. Furthermore, never have I anywhere given him support, nor would he have wished it.2 Historians have tended to regard this and similar statements by Erasmus, in which he dissociates himself from the long and bitter con- troversy between Reuchlin and the theological faculty of Cologne over the status and burning of Jewish books, as blatant and opportunistic misrepresentations of the actual relationship between himself and Reuchlin. For even though Erasmus may have been reluctant, he did, in earlier years at least, give Reuchlin his support.

Initially construed as a de- monically inspired sorcerer, Faustus subsequently passed through a series of further metamorphoses no longer holding to the relatively one-dimensional image earlier projected.

Blackie, in the preface to his rendition of Goethe\u2019s tragedy into English verse, to the fol- lowing statement: \u201cThere is much in all that is told of him [Faust] that recalls to our mind the biography of Paracelsus.\u201d 1 By the end of the nine- teenth century, this assumption acquired a degree of certainty for Goethe scholars. In 1870, Gustav von Loeper 2 remarked that Goethe\u2019s Faust is a physician and a physician\u2019s son, as is Paracelsus. Both figures detested the medicine of their time and had a predilection for the German language. Von Loeper\u2019s second edition (1879) added that the historical Faust and Paracelsus were both traveling scholars. 3 Karl Julius Schr\u00f6er in 1879, 4 1881, and 1886; 5 Calvin Thomas in 1892; 6 and Jacob Minor, in 1901, 7 ", "1242676a33df79416caac6c926ef5c5f1e767935a706f489fe9c0d9d75fde8c2": "Johannes Trithemius: The art of drawing spirits into crystals The Magic and Philosophy of TRITHEMIUS OF SPANHEIM; containing his book of SECRET THINGS, and DOCTRINE OF SPIRITS with many curious and rare secrets (hitherto not generally known;) THE ART OF DRAWING SPIRITS INTO CRYSTALS, &c.

The first four books of the Polygraphia contain code-words printed in bold, gothic type, arranged in double columns and correlated to letters of the alphabet. The last two books, printed in red and black on 23 leaves, give tables of commutation and transposition of letters and numerical symbols. In addition, the work contains numerous alphabets, some fantastic and some, like the Runic alphabet, esoteric. The Polygraphia is, by its own definition, a manual of cryptography - the first, and for many decades, the most complete manual available.

This period, now called the Renaissance, is generally considered to be one of the high points of Western civilization. How did it come about, and what were the forces that converged to spark such an explosion of creative activity? In this study, Ingrid Rowland examines the culture, society, and intellectual norms that generated the High Renaissance. Fueled by a volatile mix of economic development, scholarly longing for the glories of ancient civilization, and religious ferment, the High Renaissance, Rowland posits, was also a period in which artists, patrons, and scholars sought \u201cnew methods for doing new things.\u201d This interdisciplinary study assesses the intellectual paradigm shift that occurred at the turn of the fifteenth century.

Both seeing how Shakespeare used the Petrarchan conventions and noting the shift from courtly love to Platonism within the sonnets have helped clarify Shakespeare's artistry and his thought. Yet too frequently study of such matters ends with one of two problems. Study of the conventions in themselves has led to a kind of fragmenting of the thought of the son\u00ad nets as a whole, so that though readers may know the source of each timber in the structure, they lose sight of the archi\u00ad tecture of the whole.

T. NOWOTTNT DESPITE Shakespeare's own description of his sonnets as being 'far from variation or quick change', they have proved to be remarkably resistant to generalizations. It is, however, the purpose of this article to suggest that there is one generalization that can be made about them; one, moreover, that affords a point of view from which it is always helpful to regard them: namely, that the Sonnets reveal Shakespeare's strong sense of form, and that it is with respect to their form that the peculiar features or striking effects of individual sonnets may best be understood. There are in the Sonnets so many experiments with form that it would be difficult to lay down at the outset a definition of 'form' at once comprehensive and precise, but the meaning of the term as it is used here will be sufficiently indicated by describing 'form' as 'that in virtue of which the parts are related one to another', or indeed ", "f835755f392117fd45197c95f582c5b2b2e7e2336a9f6368fffb7a0141e5e79d": "All too Short a Date: Internal Evidence in Shakespeare's Sonnets J.

Nevertheless, he has wrought wonders with the elected three, and some of the scholarly dove-cotes appear to have been suitably fluttered. If the dis- crimination and plausible presentation of contemporary allu- sion can be said to constitute evidence, it must be conceded that Dr. Hotson has gone a very long way towards substantiat- ing his claim that Sonnets cvii, cxxiii and cxxiv were written in 1589.

'Lord of my love' is a finely complex phrase. It takes up the conventional address 'my lord' and makes it more specific - the poet is not the dedicatee's servant except in the service of love. And so the poet performs all his servant-like duties in the service of love. The phrase simultaneously affirms the love-bond and asserts the respectful distance of the poet from the lord. This distance is recorded in the sonnets in many places and in many ways.

However, rather than a developed study of the occult arts and their implications for late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century science, the book ori- ents itself deliberately in the direction of traditional Renaissance literary scholar- ship.

But neither he, nor any other writer that I have seen, appears to have noticed, what must have been obvious to contem- poraries, that Helena was modelled mainly, if not entirely, on Constance Kent, The \" Road \" murderess. Like Helena Constance lost her mother, when she and a brother a year younger than herself were quite small children. They were brought up, but not actively ill-treated like the Landlesses, by a stepmother, against whom Constance nursed a grievance because of slights upon her mother, just as Neville Landless does against Drood for fancied slights on Rosa Bud: and she became \" secret and revengeful,\" as he did.

But if this is so, what is there in the passage to make A the audience penetrate Volpone's thought, and recall Bithynian Antinous? Nothing, except the epithet 'young'; and Mr. Warren is not able to deny this epithet to the Homeric Antinous, whom he describes as 'neither a romantic wooer' (though in Davies's Orchestra he seems to be, since he makes 'courtly love' to Penelope) 'nor even necessarily young' (my italics: in Orchestra he is 'fresh and jolly' and has 'beauty'). Furthermore, it is not a matter of Volpone's 'comparing himself to Antinous.

This paper seeks not to offer any fresh insights on dating or identities but to draw attention to one dimension of the predominant themes of love and time in the sonnets that, to my knowledge, has never been examined.

For the English Renaissance this is an unusual profile. Almost exclusively, the writers who composed sonnet sequences were not the same as those who worked in the theater. The sonneteers, rather than being professional dramatists, belonged predominantly either to an amateur class of poets (for exam\u00ad ple, Sir Philip Sidney and Richard Barnfield) or to a laureate class (Edmund Spenser and Michael Drayton). 1 By contrast, the main professional dramatists (from Thomas Kyd to John Ford) did not produce sonnet sequences, even though nearly without exception they wrote in other poetic forms, from love lyric and pastoral to epyllion and satire. 2 The main exceptions are Samuel Daniel, Thomas Lodge, and Fulke Greville, all of whom wrote a sonnet sequence but none of whom bequeathed us more than a few plays.

If in life the Macbeths have a strange relationship to Duncan's agency in death they resemble their victim. We have been hearing, and writing, for several years now about the need to educate ourselves about the multiple and shifting categories of gender, class, and race not only in the early modern period but also in our own time.

It honestly assesses the accom\u00ad plishments of previous scholars, as well as its own strengths and shortcomings, and generously looks ahead to future scholarship on the theory and practice of feminist Shakespeare.

During the last two decades, clas- sicists in particular have engaged in a lively discussion over \u201cmagic\u201d and have produced an impressive amount of written output. Given the impossibility of de\u0133ining \u201cmagic\u201d in a consistent and widely accepted manner, one cannot help but wonder what these scholars are actually talking about. Hence this paper purports (a) to critically review the recent debate on \u201cmagic\u201d in Classical Studies, (b) to advocate for abandoning an abstract category of \u201cmagic\u201d in favour of a proper analysis of ancient sources and (c) to his", "e515eda56e29fbebd5e65be683dc4bc0fd03b8ea8566fce12399783e9bb1ecd8": "Discourse theory trumps discourse theory: Wouter Hanegraaff\u2019s Esotericism and the Academy Bernd-Christian Otto* Institute for Religious Studies, University of Erfurt, Germany ABSTRACT This review article argues that Wouter Hanegraaff\u2019s Esotericism and the Academy is deeply in \ufb02uenced by a methodological cluster usually referred to as \u2018discourse theory .\u2019 That the author is not willing to classify his own approach as such is explained with recourse to his dispute with Kocku von Stuckrad, who, according to Hanegraaff, would embody discourse theory, whereas Hane- graaff would embody history.

We should never forget how utterly unsophisticated the tenets of eighteenth-century rationalism have left us, believers and unbelievers alike, in that complex arena we blithely dub \u2018spiritual\u2019. Even as we see all too clearly the kitsch of much New Age religiosity and fear the rigidity of rising fundamentalism, we remain alarmingly blind to our own unconscious tendencies in this same direction.. We forget that Western culture is equally about Platonism and Aristotelianism, idealism and empiricism, gnosis and episteme, and that for most of this culture\u2019s history one or the other has been conspicuously dominant d and dedicated to stamping the other out.

The contributors look at how issues such as globalisation and technology affect ritual performance and how minorities often utilise performances to affirm their own identities while also speaking to outsiders. The contributors examine the relationship between ritual meaning and social identity through case studies drawn from the Pacific, Indonesia, the Mediterranean, West Africa, Scandinavia and Latin America. Study of the theoretical underpinnings of social action affirms the independence of anthropology as a discipline distinct from cultural, media and performance studies, according it a role in elucidating contemporary and emergent human conditions.

We know Nider was highly educated; we know he was ambitious; we know he was prominent. What we wish to show is what the Formicarius is about and why it was written. It is the purpose of this paper to achieve diese goals. The Formicarius is a series of sermons written by the wise and eminent Dominican Johannes Nider1. The dates of the actual writing of this work are not known exactly, although it is conjectured that Nider started it in 1424 or 1425. Manuscripts of the Formicarius were found in Vienna, Basel, Munich, and Wiesbaden. It went through six editions, the first two being incunabula.

Drawing on anthropology, archaeology, literature and history, Hutton shows how hags, witches, the fairy queen, and the Green Man all came to be, and how they changed over the centuries. Hutton looks closely at four main figures \u2013 Mother Earth, the Fairy Queen, the Mistress of the Night, and the Old W oman of Gaelic tradition. He challenges decades of debate around what have long been thought to be pre-Christian goddesses. While making the compelling case that these \u2018goddesses\u2019 found in the European imagination did not descend from the pre-Christian ancient world, Hutton also shows that they have nothing Christian about them.
