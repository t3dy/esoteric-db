    "text": "You were telling me lately of the dispute which you and Lorenzo de' Medici had concerning being and unity, and how, taking his stand with the Platonists, that man of a genius so powerful and versatile that he seems made for all things, who finds (wonderful to relate!) even in the incessant occupations of the State leisure for some literary study or conversation, argued against Aristotle, whose Ethics you expounded publicly this year. And since those who estrange Aristotle from Plato estrange themselves also from my point of view -- for I hold to the concord of both systems --, you ask me how we might defend the Stagirite on this point and bring him into agreement with his master, Plato. I have told you what came into my mind at that time, and it was rather a confirmation of your own objections against Lorenzo than a contribution of anything new. But you are not content with that. Without waiting for the developments which will come to the subject in my future Concord of Plato and Aristotle,2 you beg me to run over for you now, in the shape of a brief commentary, those things which I told you in the presence of our friend Domenico Benevieni, so dear to us for his knowledge and his integrity. How can I refuse you? Especially in a literary matter like this, and in the case of a friend who is almost my self? Pardon me, nevertheless, if I risk at times to employ words which perhaps have not yet received the stamp of true Latinity. The novelty of the subject, and I might almost say necessity, have demanded this license. Do not then expect a style too elegant and chaste. As our Malius3 says, the subject itself needs no ornament; simple exposition is enough. The following, therefore, if I remember well, were the things about which we had a discussion.",

    "text": "Thereupon, a propos of a new query of Socrates -- 'But in what, Parmenides, does this gymnastic consist?' -- the sage answered by first referring him to Zeno's argument as his model. Then, passing on to a more particular instruction, he with ingenious subtlety invites his adversary to consider not only what would follow from the existence of an object, but also what would follow from its non-existence; for example, in the case of this thing (the one) of which we posit or deny the existence, one must inquire what would follow both as regards the thing in itself, and in regard to other things, and, as regards other things, both in themselves and in respect to the one.11 While he is preparing to develop these points, Socrates cries out: \"What a difficult task you set me there! I do not completely understand. But why do you not demonstrate this method which you vaunt so highly, by giving me a model on some point? I should then understand it better.\" Parmenides replies that this would be a great labor for a man of his advanced years. Thereupon Zeno insists that Parmenides ought to speak because the assembly is not numerous; if it were, the case would be different, for it is not becoming that an old man treat of such matters before a large public, since few people understand that it is necessary to consider questions so discursively in order to attain the truth.12\t11.

They do so at any rate if one agrees with Zeno that 'it is not becoming that an old man treat of such matters before a large public.' If, as some pretend,13 it were a question here of the divine hierarchies, of the first principle of all things, what discourse could we imagine more appropriate to an old man, or less calculated to make him blush? But it is beyond all dispute (unless we want to deceive ourselves) that Parmenides' subject is the dialectic method; besides, Socrates had demanded nothing else. Now, it is precisely such a subject which is, to Zeno, appropriate to a young man rather than to an old one. But for those who want other proofs, let us run through this dialogue. We shall nowhere find any dogmatic assertion, but everywhere only this question: 'If this is, what follows, and what if this is not?'\t13. i.e. Proclus and the symbolists.",

Is it really a dogmatic discourse on unity and being? There is a great difference between these two assertions: 'the one is above being,' and 'if all things are one, that one is not being.'

And this meaning is not unreasonable, for, as it is truly said, we ought to think with the few, but talk like the many. We think and judge for ourselves; we speak for the multitude, and we speak so that we may be understood. The vulgar, then, the unsophisticated, so understand being that they call anything 'being' (ens) which does not lack existence (esse), and which cannot properly be called nothing.

It follows from this concept that He is one, that a term opposite to Him cannot be imagined. See then how much they err who fashion many first principles, many gods! At once it is clear that God is truth itself. For, what can He have which appears to be and is not, He who is being itself? It follows with certainty that he is truth itself. But He is likewise goodness itself. Three conditions are required for the good, as Plato writes in his Philebus:75 perfection, sufficiency, and desirability. Now the good which we conceive will be perfect, since nothing can be lacking to that which is everything; it will be sufficient, since nothing can be lacking to those who possess that in which they will find all; it will be desirable, since from Him and in Him are all things which can possibly be desired. God is therefore the fullest plenitude of being, undivided unity, the most solid truth, the most perfect good. This, if I am not mistaken, is that tetraktuV or quaternity,76 by which Pythagoras swore and which he called the principle of ever-flowing nature. Indeed, in this quarternity, which is One God, we have demonstrated the principle of all things. But we also swear by that which is holy, true, divine; now, what more true, more holy, more divine than these four characters? If we attribute them to God as the cause of things, the entire order is inverted. First He will be one, because He is conceived in Himself before He is conceived as cause. Then He will be good, true, and finally being (ens). For since the final cause has priority over the exemplary cause, and that over the efficient (we first desire to have something to protect us from the weather, then we conceive the idea of a house, and finally we construct one by making it materially), if, as has been described in Chapter VIII above, the good pertains to the final cause, the true to the exemplary, being to the efficient, God as cause will have first of all the attribute of good, then of true, and finally of being.

And this meaning is not unreasonable, for, as it is truly said, we ought to think with the few, but talk like the many. We think and judge for ourselves; we speak for the multitude, and we speak so that we may be understood. The vulgar, then, the unsophisticated, so understand being that they call anything 'being' (ens) which does not lack existence (esse), and which cannot properly be called nothing.

For the Philosophers would have Latona's face made white by penetration and by altering the skin itself, that is truly and not superficially or by colouring alone. You may ask how this can be done? I answer, Latona must first be sought out and known, which though she be drawn from a Vile place, yet she must be sublimed to one more worthy. But if she be taken from a more worthy place, she is to be submersed in a place more vile- that is, into Dung.

The taking of these Lyons I confesse is not easy, but Lyable to many dangers. But neverthelesse it must be attempted. A Lyon feeds not with the Lyonesse, but wanders apart as Tradition relates; therefore they are to be sought and hunted for in different places. But if these two Lyons can be taken when they are Whelps, when their Claws first appear and they begin to walke which is two months after their Birth, then afterwards they may be joined upon their coming to riper Age, and the whole matter will be effected without any danger.

I answer by saying that burning Coals may lye hid under Ashes in so great a quantity that if the Ashes were but removed they would be sufficient for the dressing of meat or warming oneself; but this is a different thinge from affirming that only some small spark lyes there, which before it can be of use and administer a sufficient heat must be cherished and nourished with fresh fewell by human Act, Care and Industry, or otherwise it would be easily extinguished. The Aristotelicks assert the latter as the Platonicks do the former. Reason and Experience seem to agree with this latter, whereas the first depends only upon Imagination and Phansy. Here it may be asked why Plato wrote over the Door of his school that no one ignorant of Geometry was there to be admitted, seeing he affirmed that little boys did actually know it. Are men more unlearned than boys? Or when they grow up, do they forget what they knew when children? That cannot be supposed, for we see that Brutes do by the instinct of Nature as soon as they are brought forth abhor and avoid the danger of Fire, Water, Precipices and the like. Yet an infant neither knows nor shuns such thinges. Why do not the Bee, Fly and Gnatt precipitate themselves into the Fire, seeing that they cannot know by experience that danger will arise from it? Because nature has taught them, but she has not done so by man when he is newly born.

It is as if they should say: The most simple corporeal Figure that can be found is to be taken and divided into four Elementall Colours, becoming an Equilaterall Quadrangle. Now every man understands that this Quadration is Physicall and agreeable to Nature, by which far more benefit accrues to the Publick, and more light appears to the mind of Man, than by any meere Theory of Mathematicks when abstracted from Matter. To learn this perfectly a Geometrician acting upon solid bodyes must enquire what is the depth of solid Figures, as for example the Profundity of Sphere and Cube must be knowne and transferred to manuall use and practice. If the Capacity or Circumference of the sphere be 32 foot, how much will one of the sides of the Cube be to Equalize the Capacity of this Sphere?

The Philosophers answer that the wolf wanders up and down in the Mounteins and Valleys that he may seize his prey, which must be drawn out of their dens and preserved for Use. But the King being fatigued with the long journey he has taken from the East at length falls down, and his death is then hastened by his grief seeing himself among Strangers, deprived of all his Honours and so little esteemed as for a small price to be sold into slavery.

    "text": "Tullius has excellently described the Essentiall difference of Man whereby he is distinguished from all other animalls after this manner: As a Bird for flying, a Horse for running, so a Man is born for Reasoning. For as Lyons, Bears and Tigers do exercise and delight themselves in fiercenesse, Elephants and Bulls in strength of body, Eagles, Falcons and other Hawks in preying upon birds and swiftnesse of wings, so Man excells them and all other Creatures in Reason, Inferences and Understanding. So there is no fiercenesse, no strength of body, no swiftnesse in Brutes so great, as not to be tamed, subdued and outdone by Man's Reason only. For reason is not a thinge humane or proceeding from the Earth, but as the Poet saith a particle of divine breath sent from heaven into Man. It is sometimes called memory, sometimes the intellectuall virtue to which, if use or experience be added, Wisdom springs from thence; which is the most precious thinge that a man can obtain. For use is said to be as the Father and Memory as the Mother of so generous an offspring. But the Question is, what is true wisdom? and most worthy of man's enquiry, since the opinions concerning it are infinite, every man transferring it to their own imaginations? It may be answered that Wisdom (exception being always made of that which in divine thinges relates to the Welfare of the Soul) in human thinges does not consist in Sophisticall Arguments, Rhetoricall Speeches, Poeticall Sound of Verses, Criticall Subtility of the Grammarians. Nor in the craft of heaping up Riches by violence, lyes, deceit, perjuryes, oppression without any regard to the cryes and labour of the Poor. For wisdom is nothing else but the true knowledge of Alchymie joined with practice, which is of the greatest benefit to mankind. This is the Wisdom surpassing all thinges, which with her right hand penetrates the East, with her left hand the West, and Embraceth the whole Earth.",

Some make their dealbations of Ceruse, Sublimate Mercury, Talc reduced to Oyle and the like, by which they encrust, cover and so would whiten the outside of her skin. But the whitening encrustations fall off by every wind or liquor, because they do not penetrate the inward parts, and so deceiving only their eyes by their false Colours are not regarded well by the Philosophers. For the Philosophers would have Latona's face made white by penetration and by altering the skin itself, that is truly and not superficially or by colouring alone. You may ask how this can be done? I answer, Latona must first be sought out and known, which though she be drawn from a Vile place, yet she must be sublimed to one more worthy. But if she be taken from a more worthy place, she is to be submersed in a place more vile- that is, into Dung. For there indeed she grows white and becomes white lead, which being obtained there is no doubt of success; for from White Lead proceeds the Red Lead, which is the beginning and End of the Work.",

There is a deep Valley near the Mountein Cyth\u00e6ronem in which are seen none but flying Lyonesses.

The Lyon therefore must be taken and brought into the valley, and then immediately He will be coupled with the winged Lyonesse.

Afterwards they must both be advanced out the said Valley to the Top of the Mountein, and henceforth they will never desert one another but will always remain together in inviolable wedlock. The taking of these Lyons I confesse is not easy, but Lyable to many dangers. But neverthelesse it must be attempted. A Lyon feeds not with the Lyonesse, but wanders apart as Tradition relates; therefore they are to be sought and hunted for in different places. But if these two Lyons can be taken when they are Whelps, when their Claws first appear and they begin to walke which is two months after their Birth, then afterwards they may be joined upon their coming to riper Age, and the whole matter will be effected without any danger.

The Aristotelicks assert the latter as the Platonicks do the former. Reason and Experience seem to agree with this latter, whereas the first depends only upon Imagination and Phansy. Here it may be asked why Plato wrote over the Door of his school that no one ignorant of Geometry was there to be admitted, seeing he affirmed that little boys did actually know it. Are men more unlearned than boys? Or when they grow up, do they forget what they knew when children? That cannot be supposed, for we see that Brutes do by the instinct of Nature as soon as they are brought forth abhor and avoid the danger of Fire, Water, Precipices and the like. Yet an infant neither knows nor shuns such thinges. Why do not the Bee, Fly and Gnatt precipitate themselves into the Fire, seeing that they cannot know by experience that danger will arise from it? Because nature has taught them, but she has not done so by man when he is newly born.

The Philosophers answer that the wolf wanders up and down in the Mounteins and Valleys that he may seize his prey, which must be drawn out of their dens and preserved for Use. But the King being fatigued with the long journey he has taken from the East at length falls down, and his death is then hastened by his grief seeing himself among Strangers, deprived of all his Honours and so little esteemed as for a small price to be sold into slavery. But it is necessary that the Wolf must be taken out of a Cold Region, for those that are bred in Cold Countryes are more fierce than in Libya or Egypt by reason of their greater hunger occasioned by the externall cold. Hence the devoured King revives with the heart of a Lyon and is able afterwards to conquer all beasts.

For as Lyons, Bears and Tigers do exercise and delight themselves in fiercenesse, Elephants and Bulls in strength of body, Eagles, Falcons and other Hawks in preying upon birds and swiftnesse of wings, so Man excells them and all other Creatures in Reason, Inferences and Understanding. So there is no fiercenesse, no strength of body, no swiftnesse in Brutes so great, as not to be tamed, subdued and outdone by Man's Reason only. For reason is not a thinge humane or proceeding from the Earth, but as the Poet saith a particle of divine breath sent from heaven into Man. It is sometimes called memory, sometimes the intellectuall virtue to which, if use or experience be added, Wisdom springs from thence; which is the most precious thinge that a man can obtain. For use is said to be as the Father and Memory as the Mother of so generous an offspring. But the Question is, what is true wisdom? and most worthy of man's enquiry, since the opinions concerning it are infinite, every man transferring it to their own imaginations? It may be answered that Wisdom (exception being always made of that which in divine thinges relates to the Welfare of the Soul) in human thinges does not consist in Sophisticall Arguments, Rhetoricall Speeches, Poeticall Sound of Verses, Criticall Subtility of the Grammarians. Nor in the craft of heaping up Riches by violence, lyes, deceit, perjuryes, oppression without any regard to the cryes and labour of the Poor. For wisdom is nothing else but the true knowledge of Alchymie joined with practice, which is of the greatest benefit to mankind.

I answer, Latona must first be sought out and known, which though she be drawn from a Vile place, yet she must be sublimed to one more worthy. But if she be taken from a more worthy place, she is to be submersed in a place more vile- that is, into Dung.

The Aristotelicks assert the latter as the Platonicks do the former. Reason and Experience seem to agree with this latter, whereas the first depends only upon Imagination and Phansy. Here it may be asked why Plato wrote over the Door of his school that no one ignorant of Geometry was there to be admitted, seeing he affirmed that little boys did actually know it. Are men more unlearned than boys? Or when they grow up, do they forget what they knew when children? That cannot be supposed, for we see that Brutes do by the instinct of Nature as soon as they are brought forth abhor and avoid the danger of Fire, Water, Precipices and the like. Yet an infant neither knows nor shuns such thinges. Why do not the Bee, Fly and Gnatt precipitate themselves into the Fire, seeing that they cannot know by experience that danger will arise from it? Because nature has taught them, but she has not done so by man when he is newly born.

Now every man understands that this Quadration is Physicall and agreeable to Nature, by which far more benefit accrues to the Publick, and more light appears to the mind of Man, than by any meere Theory of Mathematicks when abstracted from Matter. To learn this perfectly a Geometrician acting upon solid bodyes must enquire what is the depth of solid Figures, as for example the Profundity of Sphere and Cube must be knowne and transferred to manuall use and practice.

The Philosophers answer that the wolf wanders up and down in the Mounteins and Valleys that he may seize his prey, which must be drawn out of their dens and preserved for Use. But the King being fatigued with the long journey he has taken from the East at length falls down, and his death is then hastened by his grief seeing himself among Strangers, deprived of all his Honours and so little esteemed as for a small price to be sold into slavery. But it is necessary that the Wolf must be taken out of a Cold Region, for those that are bred in Cold Countryes are more fierce than in Libya or Egypt by reason of their greater hunger occasioned by the externall cold. Hence the devoured King revives with the heart of a Lyon and is able afterwards to conquer all beasts.

For as Lyons, Bears and Tigers do exercise and delight themselves in fiercenesse, Elephants and Bulls in strength of body, Eagles, Falcons and other Hawks in preying upon birds and swiftnesse of wings, so Man excells them and all other Creatures in Reason, Inferences and Understanding. So there is no fiercenesse, no strength of body, no swiftnesse in Brutes so great, as not to be tamed, subdued and outdone by Man's Reason only. For reason is not a thinge humane or proceeding from the Earth, but as the Poet saith a particle of divine breath sent from heaven into Man. It is sometimes called memory, sometimes the intellectuall virtue to which, if use or experience be added, Wisdom springs from thence; which is the most precious thinge that a man can obtain. For use is said to be as the Father and Memory as the Mother of so generous an offspring. But the Question is, what is true wisdom? and most worthy of man's enquiry, since the opinions concerning it are infinite, every man transferring it to their own imaginations? It may be answered that Wisdom (exception being always made of that which in divine thinges relates to the Welfare of the Soul) in human thinges does not consist in Sophisticall Arguments, Rhetoricall Speeches, Poeticall Sound of Verses, Criticall Subtility of the Grammarians. Nor in the craft of heaping up Riches by violence, lyes, deceit, perjuryes, oppression without any regard to the cryes and labour of the Poor. For wisdom is nothing else but the true knowledge of Alchymie joined with practice, which is of the greatest benefit to mankind.

It is as if they should say: The most simple corporeal Figure that can be found is to be taken and divided into four Elementall Colours, becoming an Equilaterall Quadrangle. Now every man understands that this Quadration is Physicall and agreeable to Nature, by which far more benefit accrues to the Publick, and more light appears to the mind of Man, than by any meere Theory of Mathematicks when abstracted from Matter. To learn this perfectly a Geometrician acting upon solid bodyes must enquire what is the depth of solid Figures, as for example the Profundity of Sphere and Cube must be knowne and transferred to manuall use and practice. If the Capacity or Circumference of the sphere be 32 foot, how much will one of the sides of the Cube be to Equalize the Capacity of this Sphere? On the contrary, one might look back from the Measures which the Cube contains to the feet of each Circumference.",

The Philosophers answer that the wolf wanders up and down in the Mounteins and Valleys that he may seize his prey, which must be drawn out of their dens and preserved for Use. But the King being fatigued with the long journey he has taken from the East at length falls down, and his death is then hastened by his grief seeing himself among Strangers, deprived of all his Honours and so little esteemed as for a small price to be sold into slavery. But it is necessary that the Wolf must be taken out of a Cold Region, for those that are bred in Cold Countryes are more fierce than in Libya or Egypt by reason of their greater hunger occasioned by the externall cold. Hence the devoured King revives with the heart of a Lyon and is able afterwards to conquer all beasts. And although he is the meanest in Aspect among his six brothers, being the Youngest of them all, yet after many miseries and tribulations he shall at last come to the most powerfull Kingdom. Hereupon Gratianus in the Rosary saith: In Alchymy there is a certain noble body which moved from Master to Master, in whose beginning there shall be Misery with Vinegar, but in the End Joy with Gladnesse. And Alanus in the same place says: There is one thing to be chosen out of all, which is of a Livid Colour, having a clear liquid metallick Species, and is a thinge Hot and Moist, Watery and Combustible, and is a Living Oyle and Living Tincture, a Minerall Stone and Water of Life of wonderfull efficacy.",

    "text": "Tullius has excellently described the Essentiall difference of Man whereby he is distinguished from all other animalls after this manner: As a Bird for flying, a Horse for running, so a Man is born for Reasoning. For as Lyons, Bears and Tigers do exercise and delight themselves in fiercenesse, Elephants and Bulls in strength of body, Eagles, Falcons and other Hawks in preying upon birds and swiftnesse of wings, so Man excells them and all other Creatures in Reason, Inferences and Understanding. So there is no fiercenesse, no strength of body, no swiftnesse in Brutes so great, as not to be tamed, subdued and outdone by Man's Reason only. For reason is not a thinge humane or proceeding from the Earth, but as the Poet saith a particle of divine breath sent from heaven into Man. It is sometimes called memory, sometimes the intellectuall virtue to which, if use or experience be added, Wisdom springs from thence; which is the most precious thinge that a man can obtain. For use is said to be as the Father and Memory as the Mother of so generous an offspring. But the Question is, what is true wisdom? and most worthy of man's enquiry, since the opinions concerning it are infinite, every man transferring it to their own imaginations? It may be answered that Wisdom (exception being always made of that which in divine thinges relates to the Welfare of the Soul) in human thinges does not consist in Sophisticall Arguments, Rhetoricall Speeches, Poeticall Sound of Verses, Criticall Subtility of the Grammarians. Nor in the craft of heaping up Riches by violence, lyes, deceit, perjuryes, oppression without any regard to the cryes and labour of the Poor. For wisdom is nothing else but the true knowledge of Alchymie joined with practice, which is of the greatest benefit to mankind. This is the Wisdom surpassing all thinges, which with her right hand penetrates the East, with her left hand the West, and Embraceth the whole Earth.",

For the watery parts which abound are dryed up by a cold and dry Air (for Northern Winds bring drynesse along with them), and the Earthy body which remains, having cold and drynesse as its qualities, is congealed.

In this book, Bruce Janacek considers alchemical beliefs in the context of the writings of Thomas Tymme, Robert Fludd, Francis Bacon, Sir Kenelm Digby, and Elias Ashmole. Rather than examine alchemy from a scientific or medical perspective, Janacek presents it as integrated into the broader political, philosophical, and religious upheavals of the first half of the seventeenth century, arguing that the interest of these elite figures in alchemy was part of an understanding that supported their national\u2014and in some cases royalist\u2014loyalty and theological orthodoxy. Janacek investigates how and why individuals who supported or were actually placed at the traditional center of power in England\u2019s church and state believed in the relevance of alchemy at a time when their society, their government, their careers, and, in some cases, their very lives were at stake.

    "text": "Here is an excerpt from Hegel's History of Philosophy on Bruno. Can you summarize this and incorporate it into the essay?  Bruno, who asserts the final cause to be immediately operative, and the life immanent in the universe, asserts it also to be existent, as substance; he is therefore opposed to the conception of a merely extra-mundane understanding. To a certain extent Bruno distinguishes form and matter in substance, which itself, as the aforesaid activity of the Idea, is the unity of form and matter; thus matter has life in itself. The permanent element in the endless changes of existence is, he says, the first and absolute matter; although without form, it is nevertheless the mother of all forms, and receptive of all forms. Because matter is not without the first universal form, it is itself principle or in itself final cause. Form is immanent in matter; the one simply cannot exist without the other; thus matter itself brings about these changes of form, and the same matter runs through them all. What was at first seed becomes blade, then ear, then bread, chyle, blood, seed of animal, an embryo, a human being, a corpse, then once more earth, stone, or other substance; from sand and water frogs are produced. Here then we can perceive something which, although it transforms itself into all these things in turn, yet still in itself remains one and the same. This matter cannot be a body, for bodies have form; nor can it belong to the class which we term properties, attributes, or qualities, for these are liable to change. Thus nothing seems to be eternal and worthy of the name of a principle, except matter. Many have for this reason held matter to be the only reality, and all forms to be accidental. This error arises from the fact of their recognizing only a form of the second kind, and not that necessary first and eternal form, which is the form and source of all forms. In the same way the aforesaid matter, on account of its identity with the understanding which causes form beforehand, is itself intelligible, as the universal presupposition of all corporeality. Because it is everything in general, it is nothing in particular, neither air nor water, nor anything else, abstract or otherwise; it has no dimensions, in order to have all dimensions. The forms of matter are the inward power of matter itself; it is, as intelligible, the very totality of form. This system of Bruno\u2019s is thus objective Spinozism, and nothing else; one can see how deeply he penetrated.",

    "text": "Here is another excerpt. Can you integrate a summary of this material into the essay? Bruno here asks the question: \u201cBut this first universal form and that first universal matter, how are they united, inseparable? Different \u2014 and yet one Being?\u201d He answers by making use of the Aristotelian forms of dunamis and energeia: Matter is to be regarded as potentiality; in this way all possible forms of existence in a certain sense are included in the Notion of it. The passivity of matter must be regarded as pure and absolute. Now it is impossible to attribute existence to a thing which lacks the power to exist. Existence has, however, such an express reference to the active mode, that it is at once clear that the one cannot exist without the other, but that each of them pre-supposes the other. If therefore at all times a capacity of working, producing, creating, was there, so must there also have been at all times a capacity of being worked upon, produced, created. The perfect potentiality of the existence of things (matter) cannot precede their actual existence, and just as little can it remain after that is past. The first and most perfect principle includes all existence in itself, can be all things, and is all things. Active power and potentiality, possibility and actuality are therefore in it one undivided and indivisible principle. This simultaneousness of acting and being acted upon is a very important determination; matter is nothing without activity, form is therefore the power and inward life of matter. If matter were nothing but indeterminate potentiality, how would the determinate be arrived at? This simplicity of matter is itself only one moment of form: in wishing therefore to tear asunder matter and form, matter is at once established in one determination of form, but in so doing there is immediately established also the existence of the Other.",

    "text": "To faith spirit has truth, but in this truth the moment of certainty of self is lacking. We have seen that the object of Christianity is the truth, the Spirit; it is given to faith as immediate truth. Faith possesses the truth, but unconsciously, without knowledge, without knowing it as its self-consciousness; and seeing that thought, the Notion, is necessarily in self-consciousness \u2014 the unity of opposites with Bruno \u2014 this unity is what is pre-eminently lacking to faith. Its moments as particular forms fall apart, more especially the highest moments \u2014 good and evil, or God and the Devil. God is, and the Devil likewise; both exist for themselves. But if God is absolute existence, the question may be asked, What absolute existence is this which has not all actuality, and more particularly evil within it? Boehme is hence on one side intent on leading the soul of man to the divine life, on inducing the soul to pay attention to the strife within itself, and make this the object of all its work and efforts; and then in respect of this content he strives to make out how evil is present in good \u2014 a question of the present day. But because Boehme does not possess the Notion and is so far back in intellectual culture, there ensues a most frightful and painful struggle between his mind and consciousness and his powers of expression, and the import of this struggle is the profoundest Idea of God which seeks to bring the most absolute opposites into unity, and to bind them together \u2014 but not for thinking reason. Thus if we would comprehend the matter, Boehme's great struggle has been \u2014 since to him God is everything \u2014 to grasp the negative, evil, the devil, in and from God, to grasp God as absolute; and this struggle characterizes all his writings and brings about the torture of his mind. It requires a great and severe mental effort to bring together in one what in shape and form lie so far asunder; with all the strength that he possesses Boehme brings the two together, and therein shatters all the immediate significance of actuality possessed by both. But when thus he grasps this movement, this essence of spirit in himself, in his inward nature, the determination of the moments simply approaches more nearly to the form of self-consciousness, to the formless, or to the Notion. In the background, indeed, there stands the purest speculative thought, but it does not attain to an adequate representation. Homely, popular modes of conception likewise appear, a free outspokenness which to us seems too familiar. With the devil, particularly, he has great dealings, and him he frequently addresses. \u201cCome here,\u201d he says, \u201cthou black wretch, what dost thou want? I will give thee a potion.\u201d(5) As Prospero in Shakespeare's \u201cTempest\u201d(6) threatens Ariel that he will \u201crend an oak and peg him in his knotty entrails . . . twelve winters,\u201d Boehme's great mind is confined in the hard knotty oak of the senses \u2014 in the gnarled concretion of the ordinary conception \u2014 and is not able to arrive at a free presentation of the Idea.",

If the whole Curriculum or the whole circumference of the stars is considered, we soon find that this is the mother of all things, or the nature from which all things have arisen and in which all things stand and live, and through which all things move. And all things are formed from these same powers and remain eternally therein.\u201d Thus it is said that God is the reality of all realities. Boehme continues: \u201cYou must, however, elevate your mind in the Spirit, and consider how the whole of nature, with all the powers which are in nature, also extension, depth and height, also heaven and earth and all whatsoever is therein, and all that is above the heavens, is together the Body and Corporeity of God; and the powers of the stars are the fountain veins in the natural Body of God, in this world. You must not conceive that in the Body of the stars is the whole triumphing Holy Trinity, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. But we must not so conceive as if God was not at all in the Corpus or Body of the stars, and in this world. . . . Here now the question is, From whence has heaven, or whence borrows it this power, that it causes such mobility in nature? Here you must lift up your eyes beyond nature into the light, holy, triumphing, divine power, into the unchangeable holy Trinity, which is a triumphing, springing, movable Being, and all powers are therein, as in nature: of this heaven, earth, stars, elements, devils, angels, men, beasts, and all have their Being; and therein all stands. When we nominate heaven and earth, stars and elements, and all that is therein, and all whatsoever is above the heaven, then thereby is nominated the total God, who has made Himself creaturely in these abovementioned\u201d many \u201cBeings, in His power which proceedeth forth from Him.\u201d(13)",

I do not completely understand. But why do you not demonstrate this method which you vaunt so highly, by giving me a model on some point? I should then understand it better.\" Parmenides replies that this would be a great labor for a man of his advanced years. Thereupon Zeno insists that Parmenides ought to speak because the assembly is not numerous; if it were, the case would be different, for it is not becoming that an old man treat of such matters before a large public, since few people understand that it is necessary to consider questions so discursively in order to attain the truth.12\t11.

Now, it is precisely such a subject which is, to Zeno, appropriate to a young man rather than to an old one. But for those who want other proofs, let us run through this dialogue.

At once it is clear that God is truth itself. For, what can He have which appears to be and is not, He who is being itself? It follows with certainty that he is truth itself. But He is likewise goodness itself. Three conditions are required for the good, as Plato writes in his Philebus:75 perfection, sufficiency, and desirability. Now the good which we conceive will be perfect, since nothing can be lacking to that which is everything; it will be sufficient, since nothing can be lacking to those who possess that in which they will find all; it will be desirable, since from Him and in Him are all things which can possibly be desired. God is therefore the fullest plenitude of being, undivided unity, the most solid truth, the most perfect good. This, if I am not mistaken, is that tetraktuV or quaternity,76 by which Pythagoras swore and which he called the principle of ever-flowing nature. Indeed, in this quarternity, which is One God, we have demonstrated the principle of all things. But we also swear by that which is holy, true, divine; now, what more true, more holy, more divine than these four characters?

I should then understand it better.\" Parmenides replies that this would be a great labor for a man of his advanced years. Thereupon Zeno insists that Parmenides ought to speak because the assembly is not numerous; if it were, the case would be different, for it is not becoming that an old man treat of such matters before a large public, since few people understand that it is necessary to consider questions so discursively in order to attain the truth.12\t11.

They also say that God commanded Moses to make the law known to the people, but not to write down its interpretation or to divulge it, but to communicate it only to Jesu Nave who, in turn, was to reveal it to succeeding high priests under a strict obligation of silence. It was enough to indicate, through simple historical narrative, the power of God, his wrath against the unjust, his mercy toward the good, his justice toward all and to educate the people, by divine and salutary commands, to live well and blessedly and to worship in the true religion. Openly to reveal to the people the hidden mysteries and the secret intentions of the highest divinity, which lay concealed under the hard shell of the law and the rough vesture of language, what else could this be but to throw holy things to dogs and to strew gems among swine? The decision, consequently, to keep such things hidden from the vulgar and to communicate them only to the initiate, among whom alone, as Paul says, wisdom speaks, was not a counsel of human prudence but a divine command. And the philosophers of antiquity scrupulously observed this caution. Pythagoras wrote nothing but a few trifles which he confided to his daughter Dama, on his deathbed. The Sphinxes, which are carved on the temples of the Egyptians, warned that the mystic doctrines must be kept inviolate from the profane multitude by means of riddles. Plato, writing certain things to Dionysius concerning the highest substances, explained that he had to write in riddles",

Aristotle used to say that the books of the Metaphysics in which he treats of divine matters were both published and unpublished. Is there any need for further instances? Origen asserts that Jesus Christ, the Teacher of Life, revealed many things to His disciples which they in turn were unwilling to commit to writing lest they become the common possession of the crowd. Dionysius the Areopagite gives powerful confirmation to this assertion when he writes that the more secret mysteries were transmitted by the founders of our religion ek nou eis vouv dia mesov logov, that is, from mind to mind, without commitment to writing, through the medium of of the spoken word alone.

    "text": "To return, however, to our review of the chief points of my disputation: I have also adduced my conception of the manner in which the poems of Orpheus and Zoroaster ought to be interpreted. Orpheus is read by the Greeks in a text which is practically complete; Zoroaster is known to them in a corrupt text, while in Chaldea he is read in a form more nearly complete. Both are considered as the authors and fathers of ancient wisdom. I shall say nothing about Zoroaster who is mentioned so frequently by the Platonists and always with the greatest respect. Of Pythagoras, however, Iamblicus the Chaldean writes that he took the Orphic theology as the model on which he shaped and formed his own philosophy. For this precise reason the sayings of Pythagoras are called sacred, because, and to the degree that, they derive from the Orphic teachings. For from this source that occult doctrine of numbers and everything else that was great and sublime in Greek philosophy flowed as from its primitive source. Orpheus, however (and this was the case with all the ancient theologians) so wove the mysteries of his doctrines into the fabric of myths and so wrapped them about in veils of poetry, that one reading his hymns might well believe that there was nothing in them but fables and the veriest commonplaces. I have said this so that it might be known what labor was mine, what difficulty was involved, in drawing out the secret meanings of the occult philosophy from the deliberate tangles of riddles and the recesses of fable in which they were hidden; difficulty made all the greater by the fact that in a matter so weighty, abstruse and unexplored, I could count on no help from the work and efforts of other interpreters. And still like dogs they have come barking after me, saying that I have brought together an accumulation of trifles in order to make a great display by their sheer number. As though all did not concern ambiguous questions, subjects of sharpest controversy, over which the most important schools confront each other like gladiators. As though I had not brought to light many things quite unknown and unsuspected by these very men who now carp at me while styling themselves the leaders of philosophy. As a matter of fact, I am so completely free of the fault they attribute to me that I have tried to confine the discussion to fewer points than I might have raised. Had I wished, (as others are wont) to divide these questions into their constituent parts, and to dismember them, their number might well have increased to a point past counting. To say nothing of other matters, who is unaware that one of these nine hundred theses, that, namely, concerning the reconciliation of the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle might have been developed, without arousing any suspicion that I was affecting mere number, into six hundred or more by enumerating in due order those points on which others think that these philosophies differ and I, that they agree? For a certainty I shall speak out (though in a manner which is neither modest in itself nor conformable to my character), I shall speak out because those who envy me and detract me, force me to speak out. I have wanted to make clear in disputation, not only that I know a great many things, but also that I know a great many things which others do not know.",

Roberto Salviati, a learned Florentine friend of the prince, called the Heptaplus \u201cthe first fruits of his studies\u201d when he arranged to have it printed [Pico, De hominis dignitate, Heptaplus (10), 168]. Was Salviati embarrassed by earlier works\u2014the Commento, Conclusions, and Apology? It\u2019s likelier that he thought them forgettable than that he knew nothing about them. But simple ignorance explains silence about the unpublished Oration: Pico\u2019s nephew testified that even his uncle kept quiet about it. Readers disturbed by the Kabbalah in the Conclusions reacted predictably, but the Heptaplus was less threatening because the author had sanitized it.

In most of the Heptaplus, however, even where the book\u2019s structure and content plainly depended on Kabbalah, Pico kept the mysteries hidden until the final exposition of Bereshit that could only have baffled Christian readers and scandalized them. As in earlier works, Pico intended to mystify. He believed, and he said, that plain language would defile the holiest wisdom. He uncovered God\u2019s secrets only for an elite clever enough to unravel his allegories and break the ciphers that concealed them.

But this question is not Ibn Rushd\u2019s, inasmuch as he establishes no hierarchy between philosophy and true religion. The law can serve as a kind of preamble to philosophy, addressed to a much wider audience and containing clues to guide the philosopher in theoretical matters. But there is no question of priority. As he famously writes, in a passage that (perhaps tellingly) echoes Aristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics I.32, \u201cSince the law is true, \u2026 we, the Muslim community, know firmly that demonstrative reasoning does not lead to disagreement with what the law sets down.
