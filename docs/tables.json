Suggests integration with esotericism studies.                                 | Advocates for placing medieval ritual magic within broader epistemological frameworks.                                              | Many texts remain unedited; field is evolving but not fully mapped.                                                 | Medieval ritual magic requires recontextualization within scholarly narratives of knowledge and belief.       | \"Much of the field still depends on work not yet in print.\"                                                     | Wouter Hanegraaff\u2019s *Esotericism and the Academy*; Stuart McWilliams\u2019 *Magical Thinking*.                                                                |\n",
