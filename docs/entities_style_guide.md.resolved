# Scholarly Metadata Style Guide & Templating

This guide defines the "Rich Profile" standard for entities in the Esoteric Studies Database. Our goal is to move from "thin" records (name-only) to "thick" scholarly profiles that enable deep relational browsing.

## Implementation Strategy: "Rich Profiles"

Every entity in [entities.json](file:///C:/Users/PC/.gemini/antigravity/brain/8ef6c353-03ac-4c6f-971a-b13c1c18e6fe/esoteric_seed/docs/entities.json) should aspire to have these fields populated in its `attributes` JSON object.

### Relational Guidelines
- **Cross-Links**: Always use standard Markdown links to other files (`[Name](file:///...)`).
- **Standardization**: Dates should be YYYY or YYYY-YYYY.
- **Tone**: Maintain a "Data Science Research" tone—objective, scholarly, yet accessible.
